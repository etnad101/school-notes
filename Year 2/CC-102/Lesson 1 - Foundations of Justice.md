## Basic structure of the justice system
3 major components
### The police
responsible for enforcement of law, investigation of crimes, and arresting suspects
### The courts
Courts are adjudicatory or fact-finding bodies where criminal cases are prosecuted and determinations of guilt are rendered
### Corrections
Responsible for the administration of a sentence handed down by a judge, including the management, treatment, and supervision of offenders in teh community and correctional facilities

## The goals of the criminal justice system
1. to control crime
2. to prevent crime
3. to maintain or achieve justice

Justice - refers to ideals of fairness and objectivity
Criminal Justice - includes criminal law and procedures and includes both substantive and procedural justice
Substantive Justice - "true justice", the accuracy of a decision or outcome
Procedural Justice - refers to the fairness of the procedures used in the justice system to arrive at these decisions

A legal system can be organized in one of two ways:
1. Adversarial system
	- Used in Canada and other criminal justice systems based on common law tradition (e.g. United States, Australia and India)
	- two-sided structure where the prosecution and defence argue their cases to a judge or jury to determine a verdict
2. Inquisitorial system
	- found in countries based on civil tradition such as Germany and the Netherlands
	- more collaborative effort to arrive at the truth through an investigation of all available evidence by a judge or panel of judges

Social justice - a broader view of justice that places the ideal of justice within a larger cultural, economic, and political context

### Basic Principals of the Adversarial System of Criminal Justice
- Presumption of innocence
	- A defendant is deemed innocent until convicted by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was committed
- The Crown bears the burden of proof
	- It's the task of the crown to prove guilt, not the responsibility of the accused to prove his or her innocence
- Doli incapax ("too young for evil")
	- A child under 12 cannot be held criminally responsible or prosecuted for criminal acts
- Severe mental disorders (insanity)
	- No one is criminally responsible and liable to punishment if incapable of knowing the act was wrong owing to a mental disorder
- Attempts are crimes
	- Those who attempt crimes (going beyond the planning stage) commit an offence and are generally subject to half the penalty that the completed act would draw

## Models of Justice
Law Professor Herbert Packer proposed two theoretical models of justice or models of how the justice system functions:
1. Crime Control Model
	- "assembly line" model
	- emphasizes the early stages of the justice system through the efficient arrest and conviction of criminal offenders
	- encourage deterrence and increase police powers
2. Due Process Model
	- "obstacle course" model
	- emphasizes the due process rights of individuals
	- focuses on ensuring the protection of individual rights at each stage of the justice system
	- limit the power of criminal justice personnel
# The Rule of Law and Law of Nature
 The rule of law 
- belief that is is the law itself that is supreme and all government officials and individuals must abide by the law
- can be traced back to the **Magna Carta**
- Scope of the law
	- No one is above the law
- Character of the law
	- Laws are clear, publicized and applied evenly
	- Protect fundamental rights
- Institution of the law
	- Justice is delivered by accountable, ethical and independent representatives

The law of nature
- abstract limitation on the powers of the government
- all individuals are born with certain "inalienable rights" (rights that cannot be violated by any state-created laws)

# Constitutional Law
Constitution - the supreme law of a nation or state and sets out the blueprint for how a ruling government should be organized
Westminster Model - parliament or elected officials and the tradition of the rule of law are trusted to limit the powers of government and protect the rights of individuals
Constitutionally entrenched - a single written constitution that spells out the structure and powers of government

Individual rights and freedoms are protected by parliamentary supremacy under the Westminster Model.
The American model relies on judicial review

# The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
Federalism - power is distributed among a central or federal level of government and smaller regional governments

The Constitution Act, 1982 patriated the Canadian constitution and gave Canada total control over its own constitution. Canada adopted the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Basic/Fundamental freedoms found in section 2 of the charter include the freedom to:
1. Conscience and religion, thoughts
2. belief, opinion and expression
3. association
4. peaceful assembly

Legal rights are found in sections 7-14 and include:
1. the right to be secure agains unreasonable search or seizure (section 8)
2. the right to not be arbitrarily detained, and rights on arrest (section 9)
3. the rights upon being charged with an offence (section 11)

# Limits on the Charter Rights
Rights and freedoms in the charter are not absolute.

Reasonable limits clause - rights and freedoms are guaranteed "subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"

Oakes Test
1. Courts must determine weather the law/practice in question achieves a pressing and substantial objective (the law/practice must have a goal that is important to society)
2. Courts must make a determination about proportionality. There must be a rational connection between the means adopted to limit rights and the original objective for limiting rights
3. Limitaiton of a right that is enacted to achieve a pressing objective must involve minimal impairment (government must choose the least onerous limitation available)
4. Courts will look at the proportionate effect of any limitation on a right or freedom
