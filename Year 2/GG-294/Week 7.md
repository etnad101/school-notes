## Tourism Transport Continuum
![[Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 6.02.04 PM.png]]
## Is transport a service or product?
- Service is intangible
- service is perishable
- service is inseparable

## Transport Services offered to Tourists
- Service availability
- competitive prices
- Comfort and speed
- Ambience
- Convenience and ticketing arrangements
- contact with staff
- Image
- safety
## Transportation and Tourism
- In order for tourism to grow, transportation infrastructure must
	- Be well-built, reliable and safe
	- have fair prices, be accessible modes of transportation
## Freedom of the Air
- Flag Carriers
	- Airlines that are owned in whole or in part by a national government
	- Flag carriers are a national interest
		- Maybe not for the EU but for small islands
		- Cannot rely on the services of another flag carrier
	- Chicago Convention of 1944
		- 9th freedom of the air
## Air transportation
- Charter flights
	- Flight that takes place outside a normal schedule
	- Often exclusive
		- resort packages
		- special events
	- Scheduled service
		- Daily, weekly, monthly
		- Open to most
## Airline Industry Regulation
- Prior to 1978
- Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
- Gov regulated
- Fares, schedules, and routes
- Wide-ranging service
- Worked to keep prices constant
- Not low or high
## Airline deregulation after 1978
- Removing government-imposed entry and price restrictions on airlines affecting service to specific
- in 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act signed into law in US
- lifted CAB price, exit and entry laws
- Hub and spoke model survives most legacy carriers
- Low-cost carrier (LLCs) - 30% of market fly point to point
- Hubs - might be more convenient
- Point-to-point - low cost
- Economies of scale and pricing advantages impact which model carriers use  
- Increase competition among carriers
## Airline Deregulation in Canada
- Canada first began deregulating the airline industry in the 1980s, when it decided to privatize Air Canada  
- The airline became privatized in 1989 and still dominates the Canadian market  
- Air Canada and WestJet control 82% of the domestic seats
- Airline industry protectionism works in two key ways:  
	1) Foreign ownership limitations, which have gradually been liberalized around the world, but rarely to the extent of allowing complete foreign ownership of an airline.  
	2) Open Skies Agreements - Canada has more than 100 agreements and many of those have been increasingly liberalized over the past couple of decades  
- 1995 with the Canada-U.S. air service agreement, allowing more international airlines to fly in and out of the country
## Airline Deregulation Cons
- Airlines abandoned less profitable routes
- Pay less for airline employees including captains
- Less secure jobs - lack of pay scale, benefits, flight restrictions
- More a la carte
	- pay for baggage and other 'services'
- Instability
- Major fluctuation
	- Not really deregulated
## Monopoly
- Major airlines can dictate amount of gates in hub airport.
	- Effectively shutting out competition.
	- In U.S. eg.g Atlanta - delta
## Airline Deregulation Pros
- Lower fares
- Less empty seats
	- Allows airlines to discount
- Better Quality service
- More efficient route structure
	- Hub and spoke
## Low-cost carriers
- Short turnaround times on the ground
- Use of secondary airports
- Flexibility in staff rostering
- Outsourced ground support
- Leased aircraft
- Standardized aircraft
- Point-to-point flights
## Point to Point system
- Older than the hub and spoke system
- Budget carriers
- Often more direct than hub and spoke.
- More short-haul flight
	- smaller planes
	- more connections
	- fewer cities
## Canada's Airline Dilemma
- Air Canada – 1937 (1960), Canada’s national carrier, gov’t 6.4% owned, several financial restructurings over 30 years, point-to-point  
- Air Transat (charter)  
- Westjet – 1994, initially ‘low cost’ alternative to AC, private, several owners initially – hub and spoke  
- Swoop, Sunwing (charter) 
- Flair – 2005, private, ultra-low-cost airline  
- Porter – 2006, private, ‘doing things better’
## Critical issues with air travel
- Lack of demand (many issues)
- Low-cost airlines - budget carriers
- Removal of services (cost for them)
- The global price of Oil/Fuel affects cost.
- Political unrest - impacts demand.
- C02 emissions
## Most environmentally conscious transport;
- The report assesses the value of travel by train and plane.  
- Rail travel is the best and most sensible mode of travel, apart from walking or cycling
- Aviation’s emission impacts are much higher on a passenger-kilometre basis.  
- But flying is not necessarily the most harmful choice 
- Travel by a petrol or diesel-powered car, especially if travelling alone, can be more harmful
## No-Fly Movement Protests for Air Travel
- The no-fly movement is a small but growing community
- reducing the number of flights, or not flying at all
## Rail tourism
- Declined in popularity with the rise in ownership of private cars
- Declined before WWII in North America
- Still major mode of travel in Britain, Europe, Asia
- Specialty rail tours - Orient Express, rail tours, The great Canadian
