# Lecture 7 - Paradise, Product and Place: Postcolonialism and Tourism
## Paradise or Product?
- The Bahamas has a long history of colonial influences
- many Caribbean islands prospered on the plantation economy because of the imperialist-colonial influences of European nations
- Plantation economies depended on the slave economy
- The ideal image and the economy surrounding it mirror a plantation economy
	- Slaves were brought over to serve the British colonists
	- When colonisers would visit they would be served by the locals
- The tourism product is a mix between the idea of paradise and heritage
## Meanings of Place
- PLACE 
	- A particular point or location, a space that has meaning
	- Locations encompassing emotions, feelings and memories
- Politics of place = The conflicts, uncertainties, and challenges regarding the place and how different individuals/groups perceive place and its meaning (social, economic, cultural, environments)
	- The people in power tend to be the colonizers and the ones not In power are the ones brought over and serving
- Spatial dynamics of place = uneven and inequitable
## Globalization and Placelessness
Globalization - spreading of increased mobility of ideas, products, and information, to farther and farther reaches of the globe
- similar kinds of material and marketing everywhere
- Notion of spreading largely Americanized/northern culture
- Notion of weakening local, Indigenous culture
- Seeding 'sameness' everywhere manifested through familiar products e.g. Mcdonalds, Walmart, Starbucks, Tims
Creation of spacelessness = spaces that lack meanings or have lost deeper meanings for individuals or groups
## McDonaldization (Ritzer, 1993)
- a phenomenon that occurs when society, its institutions and its organizations are adapted to have the same characteristics that are found in fast-food chains
- Include efficiency, calculability, predictability, standardization, and control
- These processes have increased in tourism
## Development (with a Big D)
- originated in the 19th century
- means to create order out of social disorder to alleviate poverty and unemployment through monitoring and controlling types of development (e.g. controlling construction, monitoring pay, etc. )
- Often associated with society moving from 'low' to 'high' technology
## Legacy of tourism = Big 'D' Development
- Manage & control exactly how tourism is going to work in a country
- Powerful term to fascinate, seduce, and create dreams for locals
- attractive Idea of creating jobs and locals making money
- Improve the standard of living, with a Western understanding of progress and modernization
- 'building' the paradise
## Little 'd' development = Community centered approches
- natural bottom-up, incremental, evolutionary processes
- locals noticed big developers don't care about the people
- based on local knowledge
- more of a case-by-case basis than large scale development
- provide deeper-meaning experiences

### Colonialism = Past forms of development
- Economies and cultures of the world today are shaped by colonialism and imperialism
- Legacy of slace trade ensured that colonial powers remain the most powerful in the world
- 80% of Manchester's industrial progress from legacy of slavery
- 12 million of Africa's youngest and strogest were forcibly removed to Americas and Carribean between 1450 and 1807

Removal of Africa's Population = economic decline that blighted generations - impact is present today
Free labour for colonial powers allowed accumulation of massive wealth

### Legacies of Colonialism
- reminds us that global relations remain shaped by power dynamics
## Postcolonialism
1. destabilizing dominant discourses of development
	- rethink big D development
2. Invoking an explicit critique of the spacial metaphors in western discourse
	- deconstruct some of the structures that currently exist
3. Uncover lost history

## Jamaica Kincaid's Antigua

- has ancestors that came over from slave trade
- locals view of tourism
