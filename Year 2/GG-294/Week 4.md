# Lecture 7 - Paradise, Product and Place: Postcolonialism and Tourism
## Paradise or Product?
- The Bahamas has a long history of colonial influences
- many Caribbean islands prospered on the plantation economy because of the imperialist-colonial influences of European nations
- Plantation economies depended on the slave economy
- The ideal image and the economy surrounding it mirror a plantation economy
	- Slaves were brought over to serve the British colonists
	- When colonisers would visit they would be served by the locals
- The tourism product is a mix between the idea of paradise and heritage
## Meanings of Place
- PLACE 
	- A particular point or location, a space that has meaning
	- Locations encompassing emotions, feelings and memories
- Politics of place = The conflicts, uncertainties, and challenges regarding the place and how different individuals/groups perceive place and its meaning (social, economic, cultural, environments)
	- The people in power tend to be the colonizers and the ones not In power are the ones brought over and serving
- Spatial dynamics of place = uneven and inequitable
## Globalization and Placelessness
Globalization - spreading of increased mobility of ideas, products, and information, to farther and farther reaches of the globe
- similar kinds of material and marketing everywhere
- Notion of spreading largely Americanized/northern culture
- Notion of weakening local, Indigenous culture
- Seeding 'sameness' everywhere manifested through familiar products e.g. Mcdonalds, Walmart, Starbucks, Tims
Creation of spacelessness = spaces that lack meanings or have lost deeper meanings for individuals or groups
## McDonaldization (Ritzer, 1993)
- a phenomenon that occurs when society, its institutions and its organizations are adapted to have the same characteristics that are found in fast-food chains
- Include efficiency, calculability, predictability, standardization, and control
- These processes have increased in tourism
## Development (with a Big D)
- originated in the 19th century
- means to create order out of social disorder to alleviate poverty and unemployment through monitoring and controlling types of development (e.g. controlling construction, monitoring pay, etc. )
- Often associated with society moving from 'low' to 'high' technology
## Legacy of tourism = Big 'D' Development
- Manage & control exactly how tourism is going to work in a country
- Powerful term to fascinate, seduce, and create dreams for locals
- attractive Idea of creating jobs and locals making money
- Improve the standard of living, with a Western understanding of progress and modernization
- 'building' the paradise
## Little 'd' development = Community centered approches
- natural bottom-up, incremental, evolutionary processes
- locals noticed big developers don't care about the people
- based on local knowledge
- more of a case-by-case basis than large scale development
- provide deeper-meaning experiences
## Colonialism and Imperialism

### Colonialism = Past forms of development
- Economies and cultures of the world today are shaped by colonialism and imperialism
- Legacy of slace trade ensured that colonial powers remain the most powerful in the world
- 80% of Manchester's industrial progress from legacy of slavery
- 12 million of Africa's youngest and strogest were forcibly removed to Americas and Carribean between 1450 and 1807

Removal of Africa's Population = economic decline that blighted generations - impact is present today
Free labour for colonial powers allowed the accumulation of massive wealth

### Legacies of Colonialism
- reminds us that global relations remain shaped by power dynamics
## Postcolonialism
1. destabilizing dominant discourses of development
	- rethink big D development
2. Invoking an explicit critique of the spatial metaphors in Western discourse
	- deconstruct some of the structures that currently exist
3. Uncover lost history

## Jamaica Kincaid's Antigua
- Resident of Antigua
- has ancestors that came over from the slave trade
- locals view of tourism
- post-colonial way of writing

## Tourism and Neocolonialism
- tourism is a form of neocolonialism
	- People who have control over tourism have similar behaviour to colonizers
- North and west dominating power over 'South'
- Dependency on foreign power and investment
# Lecture 8 - Media Influences Tourism Marketing and Destination Image Formation
How do we form a destination image?
What factors influence a destination image?
what impacts do positive and negative images have on the destination?

## Destination Image Formation
#test
Cognitive image - Knowledge and beliefs about a destination
- Easier to measure, quantify based on destination attributes
- studied more often

Affective Image - Emotional responses to a destination
- What we feel, our emotional connection
- more subjective, difficult to measure
- More recently explored in different research

## What do we mean by IMAGE
the perceptions of individual attributes of a destination and the holistic impression made by a destination

## Organic image
- perceived images of a destination derived from non-tourist sources (general media, books, news)
## Induced Image
- perceived images derived from commercial sources such as travel brochures, guidebooks, travel agents
- Can also be called **projected Image**
- tourism media, brochures, magazines, advertisements, guidebooks are considered official marketing media, but can also be unofficial marketing too
## Naïve image
- consists of organic and induced images
- meaning inexperienced/haven't been to the destination
## Re-evaluated image
- Derived from perceptions after visiting the destination
- used to determine visitor satisfaction
## Ideal Images
- perceptions of a mythical place or utopia
- Not a clear definition given in the literature
- certain characteristics - pleasant climate, beautiful scenery, friendly atmosphere, lack of congestion
- e.g. unrealistic induced or Naïve image
## Why is destination image important?
- increase awareness of positive and negative aspects of a destination
- improve understanding of image to assist with destination marketing and promotion
- Relate destination image perceptions to visitor and trip characteristics 
- Understand how visitors images are affected
- DMOs (Destination marketing organizations) seek to produce and promote hte "ideal" image of their destination for visitors
- "ideal" image must not be far removed from real experience
## Insta-worthy tourism
- Destinations, sites and attractions posted to social media sites not associated with DMOs or tourism supply
- Destination images uploaded/shared through social media are unofficial marketing sources
- Unofficial marketing has an astronomical impact
## Positive Impact of Insta-worth Tourism
- Increase tourism demand for particular destinations
- provide economic benefits for community
- Spur local employment in new tourism enterprises
- Motivate small and medium enterprises
- create interest in destination by investors
## Negative Impact of Insta-worth Tourism
- increase tourism demand for only a specific target market
- tourism employment is marginal, seasonal, low-wage
- create interest by foreign investors and non-local development
