## Authenticity
- Objective authenticity - authenticity of originals, of actual things (are they real;?) (e.g. a heritage building, objects in a museum)
- Constructive authenticity - authenticity projected on objects, or things (e.g. souvenirs)
- Postmodern authenticity - we know it isn't authentic but enjoy it anyway (e.g. Las Vegas)
- Existential authenticity - based on your own experience - you make it authentic based on experience (e.g. deep environmental experience at Pinery Provincial Park)
- Staged authenticity - an event or a display staged for teh purpose of entertainment (tourism) (e.g. Naghol in Banuatu)

- [?] When is a souvenir authentic or does it matter?

## Socio-Cultural Budget
- Doxey's Index of Tourist Irritation
	- Used to define the social impacts of tourism on residents
	- as impacts from tourism increase, a community passes through a predictable sequence of reactions toward it
	1. Euphoria
		- happy for economic benefit, 
	2. Apathy
		- Starting to see some negative impact
	3. annoyance
		- 
	4. Antagonism
		- Fighting back/protesting about tourism
## Positive Impacts
- Enhances destination image and pride
- supports infrastructure and amenities
- promotes peace
- allows for diversification of leisure opportunities (more facilites)
	- e.g. events like concerts, sports games, ski hills
- Broadens educational and cultural horizons
	- Breakdown of class race, religious cultural, and political barriers (host and guest interaction)
- Provides local employment
	- Decreases social inequality
- stronger appreciation of local culture and heritage
- can promote the conservation and preservation of heritage and tradition
- revival of traditional arts, crafts, and festivals
## Negative Impacts
- Increased density
	- crowding and noise traffic and congestion
	- pollution
	- loss of privacy
- social problems
	- crime, vandalism, drugs
	- gambling alcohol
- Change is too rapid
	- Conflict between generations and behaviours
	- Disruption of lifestyle
#test
- Perpetuates negative stereotypes
	- Ethnocentrism
		- supports tourists' traditions over local tradition
		- Perspective where one culture is viewed as superior or has more power than others
		- Traditionally white, western, European, Christian cultures
- Commercialization/commoditization
	- Aspects of culture are sold for the purposes of consumption
	- festivals, ceremonies
	- some feel all culture is commoditized as soon as tourism is involved
	- Handicrafts / Trinkets / Arts
- Erosion of traditions
	- Staged authenticity / Assimilation
		- Back regions - what tourists don't see
		- Front regions - what they are allowed to see
- Loss of language
- Child Labour
## Commodity Fetishism
- A ferry has a use value, a cruise ship has a perceived value, the price you pay for a cruise vacation, the 'exchange value' (price) has no real relation to the labour, material or impact costs of that cruise
## Environmental Impacts
- The quality of the environment, both natural and man-made, is essential to tourism
- However, tourism's relationship with the environment is complex

#test
## Carrying Capacity
- Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC): 
	- the level of human activity an area can accommodate without the area deteriorating, the resident community being adversely affected or the quality of visitors' experiences
- Physical Carrying capacity
	- \# of visitors a site can handle
- Economic carrying capacity
	- level of 'change' a destination can handle economically because of tourism
- Social carrying capacity
	- Doxey’s Inidex, antagonism among residents
- Ecological carrying capacity
	- E.g. how much tourism can an ecosystem can handle without being negatively impacted (species loss, flora damage)

- Simple concept, but Difficult to implement
- Dynamic nature of ecosystems makes it difficult to calculate
- It can be increased/decreased by management actions or human use
## Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC)
- LAC consists of 4 major components
	- Specifies acceptable and achievable conditions
	- Analyzes existing conditions and acceptable change
	- Identifies management actions to achieve desired conditions
	- monitors and evaluates management effectiveness
## Negative Environmental Impacts
1. Destroys the environmental resources on which it depends
2. occur when the level of visitor use is greater than the environment's ability ot cope
### Three main impact areas
#### Depletion of natural resources
- Water resources
	- overuse of water
	- golfing
- Land degradation
	- physical land being destroyed for development
	- Increased construction of tourism facilities has increased the pressure on natural resources
	- Forests often suffer deforestation
- Natural species loss
	- Destruction of habitad
	- Direct contact w/ tourists
- Pressure on Local Resources
	- Energy, food, and other raw materials
	- Greater extraction and transport of these resources
#### Pollution
- Air emissions
- Noise
- Solid waste and littering
- Releases of sewage
- Oil and chemical
- architectural/visual pollution
#### Physical Impacts of Tourism Development
- Construction activities and infrastructure development
- Deforestation
- Unsustainable use of land/water
- Coral reefs
- Trampling
### Environmental Threats to Tourism
- Damage caused by environmental degradation—and the eventual loss of revenues  
- ‘non-renewable tourism resources’  
- Natural disasters
## Positive Environmental Impacts
- contributes to environmental protection and conservation  
- raises awareness of environmental values  
- serve as a tool to finance protection of natural areas
- More control of harmful activities such as logging and commercial fishing  
- Greater understanding among local residents of environmental issues
- Provides opportunity for environmental education and awareness  
- Encourages community beautification, revitalization and environmental quality  
- Promotes improved land use and management
