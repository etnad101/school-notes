# Lecture 14 - Tourism Development: Tourism Life Cycle Model
## Types of Carrying Capacity
- Physical Carrying Capacity 
	- the built environment, the physical environment is negatively impacted
- Economic
	- the economy being negatively impacted
- Social
	- residents being adversely affected
- Ecological
	- 
- Tourism

## Butler's Tourist Area Life Cycle Model
![[Screenshot 2024-11-06 at 5.56.16 PM.png]]
- Strengths
	- The model provides an understanding of change within a destination
	- Highlights the idea of carrying capacity
- Weaknesses
	- Difficult to apply the model
	- The model is destination specific, therefore not a universal model
	- difficult to measure
	- its use for tourism planning still needs to be demonstrated
### Exploration
- A few adventurous tourists, visit sites with no public facilities
- Visitors are attracted to the area by natural physical features or cultural events
- Visitor characteristics: specific visitor type of a select nature
- e.g. the edge of a remote glacier, ice-climbers, backcountry camping, remote villages in Tibet, Mongolia & Nepal
### Involvement
- Limited interaction between local residents and the developing tourism industry
- This leads to the provision of basic services
- Increased promotion induces a pattern of tourism seasonality
- A definite market area begins to emerge
- E.g. 20-25 years ago in Bali and Indosesia
### Development
- Development of additional tourist facilities and increased promotional efforts
- Greater control of the tourist trade by outsiders
- The number of tourists at peak periods greater than the resident population = rising antagonism by the latter towards the former
- E.g. Cottage country, Destinations with seasonality, cruise ship ports
### Consolidation
- Tourism has become a major part of the local economy, but growth rates have begun to level off
- A well-defined tourism business district (TBD) has taken shape
- Some of the older deteriorating facilities are perceived as second-rate (chain stores, hotels and restaurants)
### Stagnation
- Peak numbers of tourists and capacity levels are reached
- The resort has a well-established image, but is no longer in "fashion"
- The accommodation stock is gradually eroded and property turnover rates are high
### Post-stagnation
- Five possibilities reflecting a range of options that may be followed, depending partly on the success of local management decisions
## Case study: Cliffs of Moher, Ireland
### Involvement stage
- Before 2005 not much tourism development
- Only small visitor center, gift shops, craft vendors
- No cliff side supports or walkways - only a narrow dirt pathway
- Free
### Development stage
- After 2006, no longer free (8 euros)
- Constructed concrete walkways, fencing, information plaques
- innovative visitor center
	- Teach about topography and area
### Development - Involvement?
- Ireland experienced an economic downturn after 2008
- Domestic tourism decreased but international tourism increased - prices went down to increase demand
- need to conduct a visitor impact study to determine visitor perceptions and economic, social environmental impacts
## Niagara Falls, Canada
### Exploration
- 1820s - people began arriving at the falls because of its grand and fantastic natural beauty and awe
- some determined that this could be a tourist attraction
### Involvement
- First hotels and restaurants began appearing in the 1820s
- Other tourist attractions such as restaurants, boardwalks, walkways, viewing platforms, etc were also constructed in between 1830s and 1850s
### Development
- 1850s-1900s - continued development of htels around Clifton hills and Fallsview Avenue

- 1920s - development of campgrounds
### Consolidation
- Tourism development was rampant, Niagara Falls was a flagship attraction with several secondary attractions that interested tourists
- Becoming known as the Honeymoon capital - even for international tourists from Europe
- Portrayed in the Superman franchise
### Stagnation
- NA recession in 1980s along with changing tastes of consumers meant that Niagara Falls went into a period of stagnation
- Hotels and restaurants losing demand
- Falls area - dilapidated, looking run down, unkempt
- "Tacky tourist" town became the image
### Decline then two periods of Rejuvenation
- 1990s - The province agreed that a rejuvenation phase was needed for Niagara Falls
- Agreed to fund Fallsview Casino resort with additional accommodations and attractions in a multi-phase development project
- This spurred increased investment from other developers - new, upgraded hotels, better restaurant franchises, mixed development
- Increased incentives, and planning management by Niagara Falls Tourism
- Better promotions, packages, transport
- Popular with sports organizations, tournaments, family travel, couples and 'girlfriend getaways'
## What happens when we exceed carrying capacity?
### Negative Tourism Impacts
- Do all negative impacts result in Over-tourism
- Over-tourism is a buzzword being used to describe severe negative impacts on tourism
- International tourism has been growing rapidly and exponentially
- Doubling between 2000 and 2019 and teh need to manage this growth more responsibly couldn't be ignored
## Overtourism
- Industry's recovery presented an opportunity to rethink the traditional tourism model
- Travel restrictions were lifted, people were itching to get out and tourism quickly rebounded
- By the end of 2024, international tourist arrivals are expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels
- Occurs when too many visitors flock to the same place, causing detrimental impacts on the environment, local communities and visitor experience
- Occurs when we see...
	- Overcrowding and congestion
	- wear and tear
	- Community resentment
	- Competition for resources
	- Environmental Consequences and Ecosystem Degradation
