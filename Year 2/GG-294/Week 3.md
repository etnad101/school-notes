# Lecture 5 - Tourism Demand: What is a tourist?

## Since the 1970s tourism has increased because...
- Growing middle class
- more disposable income
- more educated
- Designated vacation time
## The purpose of attracting tourism demand
- Tourists are where the money is made in the tourism industry
- The tourism economic sector has long been interested in the motivations, expectations, perceptions, and activity choices of tourists to maximize profits
## Tourism Demand Factors
- Effective (actual) demand
	- demand for a particular destination that is actually happening 
	- actual # of visitors able to travel
- Suppressed or latent (potential) demand
	- demand that could possibly happen but tourists/visitors are constrained or unable to travel due to constraints
- No demand
	- isn't a desire for travel ergo no demand
- Push (**DEMAND**) factors: **Motivate** individuals to seek out travel experiences - (where the tourists come from)
- Pull (**SUPPLY**) factors: **Attract** tourists to a destination (IN the destination)
- The interaction of push and pull factors shape both destinations and tourists
## Heterogeneity Problem
- PARTICIPATION DECISION - Tourism does not offer utility to everybody
- INTENSITY OF DEMAND - Tourism is demanded with different intensity by different households
- DESTINATION CHOICE - Tourists have different tastes and multiple destinations to choose from
## Elasticity of Demand in Tourism
- Tourism is considered to be demand-elastic - consumers are sensitive to price rise
- As prices rise, demand reduces
- If income rises, price remains the same, then demand increases
## Factors Affecting Demand
### Economic determinants
- Personal incomes (whether incomes rise/fall with inflation)
- Distribution of Incomes (% high, middle, low incomes)
- Value of currency/exchange rates
### Social Determinants
- Demographic variables (age, marital status, gender)
- Holiday entitlements (amount of leisure time)
## Market Segmentation
what
- Categorizing potential customers into groups with similar wants/needs
- Grouping customers into homogeneous groups based on a set of criteria e.g. similar activity preferences
why
- to determine target markets 
- to maximize customer satisfaction and profits as a result
## Four Segmentation Approaches
1. Geographic
	- basic, simple oldest way
2. Demographic
	- most popular method
	- Regularly collected and available (e.g. Canadian census data)
	- Gender, age, occupation, education, income, household size, and family situation
3. Psycographic
	- More advanced and complicated
	- Based on how they live, their priorities, and interests
	- Lifestyle (AIO)
		- Activities
		- Interests
		- Opinions
4. Product-Related
	- Based on consumer needs and wants in a particular good or service
	- Leisures vs. Business
	- Different travel behaviours
