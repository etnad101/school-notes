# Lecture 5 - Tourism Demand: What is a tourist?

## Since the 1970s tourism has increased because...
- Growing middle class
- more disposable income
- more educated
- Designated vacation time
## The purpose of attracting tourism demand
- Tourists are where the money is made in the tourism industry
- The tourism economic sector has long been interested in the motivations, expectations, perceptions, and activity choices of tourists to maximize profits
## Tourism Demand Factors
- Effective (actual) demand
	- demand for a particular destination that is actually happening 
	- actual # of visitors able to travel
- Suppressed or latent (potential) demand
	- demand that could possibly happen but tourists/visitors are constrained or unable to travel due to constraints
- No demand
	- isn't a desire for travel ergo no demand
- Push (**DEMAND**) factors: **Motivate** individuals to seek out travel experiences - (where the tourists come from)
- Pull (**SUPPLY**) factors: **Attract** tourists to a destination (IN the destination)
- The interaction of push and pull factors shape both destinations and tourists
## Heterogeneity Problem
- PARTICIPATION DECISION - Tourism does not offer utility to everybody
- INTENSITY OF DEMAND - Tourism is demanded with different intensity by different households
- DESTINATION CHOICE - Tourists have different tastes and multiple destinations to choose from
## Elasticity of Demand in Tourism
- Tourism is considered to be demand-elastic - consumers are sensitive to price rise
- As prices rise, demand reduces
- If income rises, price remains the same, then demand increases
## Factors Affecting Demand
### Economic determinants
- Personal incomes (whether incomes rise/fall with inflation)
- Distribution of Incomes (% high, middle, low incomes)
- Value of currency/exchange rates
### Social Determinants
- Demographic variables (age, marital status, gender)
- Holiday entitlements (amount of leisure time)
## Market Segmentation
what
- Categorizing potential customers into groups with similar wants/needs
- Grouping customers into homogeneous groups based on a set of criteria e.g. similar activity preferences
why
- to determine target markets 
- to maximize customer satisfaction and profits as a result
## Four Segmentation Approaches
1. Geographic
	- basic, simple oldest way
2. Demographic
	- most popular method
	- Regularly collected and available (e.g. Canadian census data)
	- Gender, age, occupation, education, income, household size, and family situation
3. Psycographic
	- More advanced and complicated
	- Based on how they live, their priorities, and interests
	- Lifestyle (AIO)
		- Activities
		- Interests
		- Opinions
4. Product-Related
	- Based on consumer needs and wants in a particular good or service
	- Leisures vs. Business
	- Different travel behaviours

different kind of tourists defined by cohen

## Zultan (2004)
- classifications of tourists based on the purpose of the trip, destination chosen, and behaviour exhibited at the destination
	- *The planning tourist*: plans their trip
	- *The social tourist*: family/friends
	- *The impulsive tourist*: Last-minute/spontaneous 
	- *The marketing tourist*: choose a location that is widely advertised
	- *The conventional tourist*: use travel agents
## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
 ![[maslows hierarchy.png]]
 In relation to tourism:
 - Self-actualization: search for authenticity/reality
 - Esteem: "Collecting places"
 - Belongingness: travel with family, friends, relatives, or other social group members
 - Aesthetic/cognitive: the desire for self-fulfillment, educational tours, culture and language learning programs
 - Safety needs: Food safety, safari rides
 - Physiological needs: Staying at a hotel, dining at restaurants
## How has the tourism sector met diversity in demand?
- niche forms of tourism from the supply side
- policy creation from gov't
	- labour laws
	- employment policy
	- HR
- policy creation from NGOs, charities
- private entrepreneurs/corporations - EDI, mandates
- planning/management
	- create more extensive target marketing
- Image Creation
	- if you see it you believe it 
# Lecture 6 - Tourism Marketing and Placemaking
## Destination concept
people develop emotional connections to places based on different factors
Destination = location tourists go to
Scale of a Destination:
- National - Canada
- Regional - Atlantic provinces
- Even more regional - Nova scotia
- Local - Halifax

## Evolution of marketing in tourism
### Production Era
- Products priced cheaply
- would sell regardless of consumer preferences
- product oriented view
### Sales Era
- selling was the prime focus of the market's willingness to accept the product
### Marketing Era
- businesses produce products they could sell which were tailored to consumer needs to satisfy
- notice post-fordist economy, flexible income
- started late 1980s to early 1990s
## Principals of services marketing
- Intangible - experiences/services
- Perishable - cannot store services
- Heterogeneity - services difficult to standardize
- Inseparable 
	- service and consumption occur at the same time
	- cannot separate service from destination
- Lack of ownership - bring back memories/feelings/experiences, not the resort itself
## Relationship marketing
Adding of value
- adding value to an experience based on amenities offered, satisfaction, and services offered
- Build long-term relationships between customers and buyers
## Perceived Value
- multifaceted concept = 
	- quality of services
	- emotional responses
	- monetary price
	- behaviour price
	- reputation

## Place marketing
Destinations distinguish themselves from their competition by creating a product or a place 'brand'

- Engaging citizens and stakeholders in the discussion
- use stakeholder and study feedback to create a brand story
- started marketing places with meanings, or sentiments
## A sense of place
- Develop a deep connection to a certain place
- places become more personal the longer you stay
- Insiders = feel at one with place - have deep experiences with place
- Outsiders = feel alienated or perceive place as a little more than a background or setting for activities
## Sensuous Geographies
 - ["] We see, hear, smell, taste and touch the world through the mediation, the filter or lens, of our social milieu, the context within which we have become socialized, educated and familiarized (Rodaway, 1994).
## Placemaking
- Top-down(government) professional design effort to influence people's behaviour and shape their perception of place
- Happens quickly
## Place-making
- Cultural group imprints its values, perceptions, memories, and traditions on a landscape and gives meaning to a geographical space
- Incremental, organic, more about the local glabout of the community
- done by the people instead of the government
