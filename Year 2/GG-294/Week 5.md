# Lecture 9: The Economic Impacts of Tourism
## Why study the economic impacts of tourism?
- geography is about how a phenomenon impacts the physical, economic and social environments
## Economic impacts in tourism
- The most widely researched area of tourism
- several economic measurement models exist
## Economic impacts are influenced by five factors
Mathieson & Wall 1982
1. Type of tourist facility and attraction for tourists
	- e.g. having only one flagship attraction vs also having secondary and tertiary attractions
2. volume and level of tourist spending
3. Level of economic development in the region
	- less developed countries tend to have cheaper products
4. the extent to which tourist spending is maintained and recirculated in the region
	- is money being recirculated or are tourist dollars leaving due to foreign investment
5. Extent of the seasonality in the region
	- e.g. ski destinations have summer activities as well to extend the season
	
## Why tourism when...
- [?] 
- No tangible product
- Tourists require supporting goods and services
- Tourism is fragmented
- Elastic product
- perishable product
- subject to unpredictable external influences

Because it's worth it
- it can provide a lot for the local community

## Tourism is impacted by economic cycles
1. Short - Highly visible and predictable
	- e.g. abnormally mild ski season
2. Medium - over several years (event specific)
	- e.g. hurricanes in tourism-dependent states
3. Long - 40-50 years - resort cycle of evolution
	- e.g. decline in tourism in Niagara falls in the past 50 years

## Economic Benefits of Tourism
Benefit iceberg
- Direct spending by visitors in only the tip of the iceberg
	- It is relatively easy to measure
	- visitor numbers, expenditures
- Indirect and induced impact of tourism are much larger
	- subsequent spending by suppliers, induced effects, investment etc.
### Direct
- impacts arising from the initial tourism spending
	- e.g. hockey team travelling and staying in a hotel
### Indirect
- The restaurant buys goods and services (inputs) from other businesses, thereby generating indirect impacts
### Induced
- The restaurant employees spend part of their wages to buy various goods and services, thereby generating induced impacts
## Positive Economic Impacts
- Increased employment in service sector jobs
- Provides business opportunities
- Improves investment, development, and infrastructure spending
- Improved income
- A higher standard of living 
- Improved local economy
- Increased tax revenues
- Increases opportunities for shopping
- Widespread impact in the community
- **Multiplier effect**: The flow of spending through a community from tourism activities
- Housing Development
- Brings new money into the community
- alternative form of economic activity and development
	- Diversify and stabilize the economy
- Attracts additional businesses and services
- regional development
## Negative Economic Impacts
- Large monetary Investment
	- Hard infrastructure - roads, airports, hotels
	- Soft infrastructure - communications, skills
	- Support - regulatory, financial
	- Organizational - logistics, distribution
	- Marketing - customer identification and reach
- Increased cost of living
- Uncontrolled growth
- demand on public facilities
- Vulnerability to shifts if over-dependant
	- Political unrest
	- Natural catastrophes
	- Impacted by forces outside the community
- well-developed economies tourism contributes typically between 5% to 10% of the GDP
- in less developed economies the contribution is typically much greater
- Money diverted from other needs
- places new stress on existing infrastructure
- additional capital and maintenance costs for public amenities
- displaces traditional businesses
- Increasing the number of visitors means increasing the local population
### Economic Leakage
- Import Leakage
	- Occurs when tourists demand standards of equipment, food, and other products that the host country cannot supply
	- e.g. all-inclusive resorts importing food/alcohol that the country cannot supply
- Export Leakage
	- Occurs when overseas investors who finance resorts and their hotels take their profits back to their country of origin
## Gender issues
- Uneven distribution of wealth/benefits
## Case Study - Tourism in Cuba through the decades
### The pre-revolution era (1945-1958)
- Major US investment in tourism-like infrastructure and other economic activity
- Music clubs, bars, nightclubs, hotels, casinos, and restaurants - mainly in major cities along the coast
- Cubans (e.g. Fidel and Raul Castro) were tired of foreign investment in industries
### Revolution/Post-revolution era (1959-1988)
- Revolution led by Fidel and Raul Castro, Che Guevara and other Rebels ousted US supported corrupted leader Batista
- Batista supported US-controlled sugar and other industries as well as 'America's playground'
- Revolutionaries wanted to regain ownership of industries and appropriate businesses/clientele in cities (no more casinos/showgirls)
### Cuban missile crisis - Oct 1963

### Tourism revolution (1989-2002)
- Allow tourism infrastructure to develop in coastal areas within specific set regulations
- Specific foreign accommodation/resort sector
- Restricted development - no "restaurants", shopping, chains
- Many "limitations" in terms of mass tourism expectations
### 2012 to 2016: Tourism 'BOOM' or 'BUST'
- Increase in US Travel to Cuba
- First major cruise lines vying for cuban ports
- First airlines landing in Havana
- Still travel restrictions on American travel to Cuba (educational/cultural-educational tours, VFR)
- 36% increase by americans in the past 5 months 
### Tourism in cuba in 2017
- Tourist arrivals to Cuba plunged 23.6% on the year in July 2017 under trump
- Confirming the blow dealt to the sector by the Trump administrationâ€™s tightening of U.S. restrictions on travel to the Caribbean island.  
- Data from the Statistics Office had already shown a 20% drop in arrivals in June, after Washington that same month banned cruises to Cuba and made it harder for U.S. citizens to get an exemption from the ban on travel there  
- The sustained decline reverses a boom in arrivals and therefore the broader tourism industry in recent years following the U.S.-Cuban detente under former U.S. President Barack Obama that President Donald Trump is now unraveling
