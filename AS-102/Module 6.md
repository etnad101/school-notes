### Main sequence
- A line from top left to bottom right
- stars along this line are stable

Upper right
- The coolest and most luminous stars



## Star Mass Categories
### Low-mass stars 
- < 2 solar masses
- long lives (billions of years)
- Swell into red giants in the death phase
- Eventually become white dwarfs
### Intermediate-mass stars
- 2-8 solar masses
- live a few billion years
- Swell into red giants in the death phase
- Eventually become white dwarfs
### High-mass stars
- > 8 solar masses
- live 1 billion years - a few million
- 


# Lesson 5
## Initial Dying Stage
- Hydrogen shell around helium core where temp is not high enough to fuse
- As the core shrinks, the outer layers balloon out (temporarily)
- Luminosity increases and the star becomes a subgiant then a red giant
- Once the core gets hot enough it starts fusing helium into carbon and some oxygen

## Star Clusters
1. open clusters
2. globular clusters
Globular tend to be larger and much more dense

## Death of low-mass stars
### 8-40% solar mass
- dont get hot enough to form a helium core with a hydrogen shell and can never become hot enough to form a red giant
- these are red dwarfs (live 100billion years)
- unlikely a red dwarf has ever died
### 0.4 - 8 solar masses
- once all the hydrogen is used up the red dwarf has a carbon core with helium around it
- It will never be hot enough to start fusing carbon because the mass is too low
- Star ejects its outer layers into a "planetary nebula"
- Remains a planetary nebula for ~1million years until the carbon core runs out of UV-radiation
- once the star is cool and gravity and outward pressure are equal again, it becomes a white dwarf
- Eventually will cool down do a "black dwarf" when it is no longer visible

## Death of high-mass stars
### > 8 solar masses
- Start the same as low-mass stars

		"they consume the hydrogen in their cores, ignite hydrogen shells, and become giants or, for the most massive stars, supergiants. Their cores contract and fuse helium first in the core and then in a shell, producing a carbon-oxygen core"
- The He fusion process begins again after 100,000-200,000 years and the carbon core begins to collapse under gravity
- core temperature rises to ~1billion K and carbon fusion begins
- this takes a few thousand years - a few hundred is the star is very massive
- the process repeats fusing heavier and heavier elements
- the process ends when the core is iron

		At this point something called electron degeneracy cannot hold off gravitational collapse any longer and gravity forces the electrons to combine with the protons to form neutrons (and a neutrino) and the iron core becomes a core of neutrons with a mass comparable to our Sun but a size just a few kilometres across.

- This collapse takes place in a fraction of a second and is called a supernova
- This leaves behind a neutron star
