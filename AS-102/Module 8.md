# Lesson 10: The Big Bang Theory
The universe has no center or edge

## Olbers' paradox
The fact that the night sky is dark is proof that the universe has not been here forever and it had to begin at some point

If the universe was here forever, there would be light coming from all directions from stars, and there would be no darkness

Like a thick forest with trees all around, you wouldn't be able to see out

## Big Bang Theory or How It All Started
- The Big Bang was NOT an explosion
- Instead, it was a rapid expansion of the universe from a singularity
- As the universe expands, it becomes bigger, cooler, and less dense
- By reversing it, the universe will become smaller, hotter and more dense, until it becomes a singularity
- This and Olbers' paradox are where the Big Bang theory comes from

## The first 380,000 years of the universe
- Only know about our universe because of our ability to gather photons/light
- Before 380,000 years ago, the universe was opaque, and after 380,000 years it became transparent
- Everything before 380,000 years is pure speculation

### The Planck Era
- began @ t=0
- lasted for 10^-43 seconds
- temperature dropped to1 0^32 K
- All the physical forces were combined into one force

### The GUT era
- ended @ t = 10^-29 seconds
- single force split into gravity and GUT (Grand Unified Theory) force
- The GUT force would split into strong and weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic force
- possible that an "electroweak" force released a tremendous amount of energy and caused rapid expansion, referred to as inflation

### The electroweak era
- ended @ t = 10^-10 seconds old
- temp dropped to 10^15 K
- high energy photons(radiation) filled the universe
- pair production - high energy photons collide producing a matter-antimatter pair of particles. How we have mass in the universe
- annihilation - matter and antimatter collide, destroying the particles and releasing photons

### The Particle Era
- Ended @ t = 1ms
- temp dropped to 10^12 K
- elementary particles are produced through pair production

### The Era of Nucleosynthesis
- Ended @ t = 5 minutes
- temp dropped to 1 billion K
- protons and neutrons begin to fuse to form nuclei
- Electrons were too energetic to be captured by nuclei
- temp still too hot to form stable nuclei so they broke apart as fast as they formed
- Elements beyond lithium and beryllium could not be formed

### The Era of Nuclei
- Lasted until t = 380,000 years
- temp dropped to 3000k
- The nuclei and electrons move freely but are still too hot to interact with each other
- the universe was opaque like a very, very, thick fog
- by the end, the universe was cool enough that nuclei could capture and keep electrons
- and photons could travel unimpeded through the universe
- The universe is suddenly transparent

### The Era of Atoms
- Part of the universe we are familiar with
- Atoms forming clouds, asteroids, planets, etc.

### The Era of Galaxies
- began @ t = 1 billion years
- temp dropped below 1000K
- stars that formed close together cluster into galaxies
- current era

# Lesson 11: The big bang theory and experimental support
## The cosmic microwave background (CMB)
- Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias were the first to observe CMB
- Attempting to measure short radio waves but kept getting a low-level noise signal
- This was later discovered to be radiation (light) that had been travelling throughout the universe since it was 380,000 years old
- now peaks in the microwave portion of the spectrum and comes from everywhere in the cosmos

## Abundances of Light Elements
- The universe is 75% hydrogen, 25% helium, 0.1% everything else
- This was formed in the early universe in the nucleosynthesis phase
- Stars only generate a small portion of the helium today

## Dark Matter
- Dark matter could be "ordinary"/baryonic matter, or "extraordinary"/non-baryonic matter
### Ordinary Dark Matter
- Baryonic matter (made of neutrons, protons, etc)
- matter than we can't see because it doesn't emit any light 
- one proposal is that the dark matter halo is partly made up of dim objects with less than one solar mass
- these are called MACHOs (Massive compact halo objects)
	- these objects include brown dwarfs, white dwarfs or black holes
- these do not account for all the dark matter in our galaxy

### Extraordinary Dark matter
- Non-baryonic matter
- A Neutrino is a non-baryonic particle
- Neutrinos are not bound by the galaxy's gravitational field so they cannot contribute to a galaxy's dark matter components
- could be heavier, weakly interacting, particles that evade detection called WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle)
- Fairly certain dark matter exists, not sure what it is yet
- The universe contains 6x as much dark matter as ordinary matter
- Believe dark matter contains mostly WIMPs

## Structure of the Universe
- Galaxies and galaxy clusters are held together by gravity, but perhaps gravity is not holding the universe together
- Gravity doesn't seem strong enough to stop the universe from expanding
- quite likely dark matter is an essential part of the "local" gravity picture
- The universe is isotropic and homogenous
	- isotropic = same in any direction we look
	- homogenous = same wherever we are in the universe

## Model Universes and the Fate of the Universe
- if avg density < crit density, universe is open
- if avg density > crit density, universe is closed
- if avg density = crit density, universe is flat

## Inflation
