# Comparative Planetology of the Terrestrial Planets
## Terrestrial Worlds
Terrestrial planets are differentiated:
- Crust - Topmost low-density rocky layer
- Mantle - Between the crust and core, composed of dense rock
- Core - High density, metallic composition
- Atmospheres of terrestrial worlds vary from world to world
- *Old surfaces* are much more cratered than *young surfaces*
- Heat - Remnant of planet formation or generated by radioactive decay
	- flows outward and causes several processes
- Small terrestrial worlds cool off quickly and become geologically dead sooner than larger planets
- The terrestrial world can be arranged in the correct order from youngest to oldest average surface age: Earth, Mars, Venus and Moon

## Earth's Interior
- The average density (about ${5.5g}/{cm^{2}}$) indicates that the interior is made up of material denser than rock
- The metallic core (inner solid and outer liquid core), a dense rocky mantle, and a thin, low-density crust
- The liquid outer core generates Earth's magnetic field through the dynamo effect
- A mechanism by which a celestial body such as the earth or a star generates a magnetic field. The dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid can maintain a magnetic field over astronomical time scales

### Seismic Waves
- Vibrations that travel through Earth's interior tell us what Earth is like on the inside

## Earth's Active Crust
Three important points about Earth's crust:
1. The motion of crustal plates produces much of the geological activity on Earth. The molten rock that emerges from volcanoes comes from the upper mantle
2. The continents of Earth's surface have moved and changed over periods of hundreds of millions of years. The youngest crust is near mid-ocean ridges and spreading zones
3. Most of the geological features on Earth are recent products of Earth's active surface

## Earth's Atmosphere
- The first (primary) atmosphere was rich in carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapour, hydrogen and methane
- As the earth cooled, carbon dioxide was scrubbed out by the oceans, leaving the atmosphere rich in other gasses, such as nitrogen and oxygen (due to photosynthesis)
- The atmosphere we breathe today is the secondary atmosphere
- An atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide can trap heat by a process called the greenhouse effect
- The CO2 added to the atmosphere by predominantly burning fossil fuels leads to the gradual increase in the surface temperature of the earth (global warming)

## Oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere
- When Earth was young, its atmosphere had no free oxygen
- ~2-2.5b years ago, plants began to rapidly produce oxygen via photosynthesis
- Carbon dioxide was scrubbed out by the oceans, leaving the atmosphere rich in other gases such as nitrogen and oxygen (due to photosynthesis)
- Ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere protects Earth from harmful UV rays. Visible and infrared only can pass through Ozone (O3)
- CFCs(chlorofluorocarbons), produced by humans, destroy ozone. Since the late 1970s, the O3 concentration has been decreasing

## A short geological history of the earth
1. Differentiation - the separation of each planet's material into layers according to density
2. Cratering and giant basin formation - could not begin until a solid surface formed
3. Slow surface evolution - has continued for at least the past 3.5b years
