# Comparative Planetology of the Terrestrial Planets
## Terrestrial Worlds
Terrestrial planets are differentiated:
- Crust - Topmost low-density rocky layer
- Mantle - Between the crust and core, composed of dense rock
- Core - High density, metallic composition
- Atmospheres of terrestrial worlds vary from world to world
- *Old surfaces* are much more cratered than *young surfaces*
- Heat - Remnant of planet formation or generated by radioactive decay
	- flows outward and causes several processes
- Small terrestrial worlds cool off quickly and become geologically dead sooner than larger planets
- The terrestrial world can be arranged in the correct order from youngest to oldest average surface age: Earth, Mars, Venus and Moon

## Earth's Interior
- The average density (about ${5.5g}/{cm^{2}}$) indicates that the interior is made up of material denser than rock
- The metallic core (inner solid and outer liquid core), a dense rocky mantle, and a thin, low-density crust
- The liquid outer core generates Earth's magnetic field through the dynamo effect
- A mechanism by which a celestial body such as the earth or a star generates a magnetic field. The dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid can maintain a magnetic field over astronomical time scales

### Seismic Waves
- Vibrations that travel through Earth's interior tell us what Earth is like on the inside

## Earth's Active Crust
Three important points about Earth's crust:
1. The motion of crustal plates produces much of the geological activity on Earth. The molten rock that emerges from volcanoes comes from the upper mantle
2. The continents of Earth's surface have moved and changed over periods of hundreds of millions of years. The youngest crust is near mid-ocean ridges and spreading zones
3. Most of the geological features on Earth are recent products of Earth's active surface

## Earth's Atmosphere
- The first (primary) atmosphere was rich in carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapour, hydrogen and methane
- As the earth cooled, carbon dioxide was scrubbed out by the oceans, leaving the atmosphere rich in other gasses, such as nitrogen and oxygen (due to photosynthesis)
- The atmosphere we breathe today is the secondary atmosphere
- An atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide can trap heat by a process called the greenhouse effect
- The CO2 added to the atmosphere by predominantly burning fossil fuels leads to the gradual increase in the surface temperature of the earth (global warming)

## Oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere
- When Earth was young, its atmosphere had no free oxygen
- ~2-2.5b years ago, plants began to rapidly produce oxygen via photosynthesis
- Carbon dioxide was scrubbed out by the oceans, leaving the atmosphere rich in other gases such as nitrogen and oxygen (due to photosynthesis)
- Ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere protects Earth from harmful UV rays. Visible and infrared only can pass through Ozone (O3)
- CFCs(chlorofluorocarbons), produced by humans, destroy ozone. Since the late 1970s, the O3 concentration has been decreasing

## A short geological history of the earth
1. Differentiation - the separation of each planet's material into layers according to density
2. Cratering and giant basin formation - could not begin until a solid surface formed
3. Slow surface evolution - has continued for at least the past 3.5b years


# Global Warming
## History of earth's climate
- life appeared 3.8 billion years ago
- Photosynthesis began 3.5-2.5 billion years ago
	- Produced oxygen and removed carbon dioxide and methane
	- Earth went through periods of cooling ("snowball earth") and warming
- Began cycles of glacial and interglacial periods ~3 million years ago

## Origin of the Atmosphere
- Earth had a primeval atmosphere from remaining gasses captured suiting the formation of earth
- Atmospheric composition was severely altered (secondary atmosphere) through a combination of two processes
	- Outgassing of compounds from the earth's interior
	- Bombardment of icy meteoroids and comets
## Today's atmosphere
- The ozone layer is essential in protecting Earth's surface from UV radiation
- Nitrogen, oxygen and argon are the 3 most abundant gasses in the Earth's atmosphere
## Common misconceptions
- Misconception: There is life on Earth because of oxygen
	- Truth:
		- Oxygen was not part of Earth's primeval atmosphere
		- there is oxygen in Earth's atmosphere because of life
		- Photosynthesis by plants is what keeps a steady supply of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere
- Misconception: The greenhouse effect is bad for Earth
	- Truths
		- Earth has always had a greenhouse effect
		- CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas
		- Also includes water vapour, methane and other gases
- Misconception: Ozone is bad
	- Truth: The ozone layer is what protects earth's surface from harmful UV radiation
- The observed warming of the earth is a result of natural causes rather than the greenhouse effect
	- Truths:
		- Natural causes should be driving temperatures to decrease, not increase
		- Sun's luminosity has remained constant
- Misconception: All of the earth will warm at the same rate
	- Truth:
		- N. America will be warm while Europe will become more wet and cool

## Households are big contributors to climate change
- 40% of all U.S greenhouse gas emissions come from households:
	- Vehicles
	- Home heating
	- Electricity

## How can we slow down global warming?
- Reduce consumption of fossil fuels
	- GHG emissions are tied very closely to our energy consumption, using less fossil fuel-based energy puts fewer GHGs into the atmosphere
	- This will help slow global warming
	- 50% of electricity in the United States is produced from coal
	- Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel

## Vehicle use in Canada
- The transportation sector is responsible for 27 percent of GHG emissions in Canada
- 19 million light-duty vehicles on the road
- Almost 1 vehicle for every 2 Canadians
- More than 300 billion kilometres driven per year
- Poor decisions and bad habits contribute to fuel waste

## Why do Canadians Idle?
- Most common reasons for idling in summer and winter:
	- Doing an errand
	- Stopping to talk to an acquaintance of a friend
	- Using restaurant drive-throughs or stopping for take-out food
	- waiting to get gas
	- stopping to use a cellular phone warming up a vehicle
	- waiting for someone

### How much do Canadians idle?
- Eight minutes a day in the peak of winter
- 75 million minutes per day nationally 

### Why idling is a problem
- Unnecessary vehicle idling:
- wastes a lot of fuel and money
- Depletes a valuable non-renewable resource
- Needlessly increases GHGs that contribute to climate change

## Impacts of climate change
- Increasing levels of GHGs are trapping heat in the atmosphere
- Global warming triggers changes in climate
- GHG emissions can magnify the effects of air pollution
- Air quality problems and health problems
