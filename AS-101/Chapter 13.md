# Comparative Planetology of the Terrestrial Planets
## Terrestrial Worlds
Terrestrial planets are differentiated:
- Crust - Topmost low-density rocky layer
- Mantle - Between the crust and core, composed of dense rock
- Core - High density, metallic composition
- Atmospheres of terrestrial worlds vary from world to world
- *Old surfaces* are much more cratered than *young surfaces*
- Heat - Remnant of planet formation or generated by radioactive decay
	- flows outward and causes several processes
- Small terrestrial worlds cool off quickly and become geologically dead sooner than larger planets
- The terrestrial world can be arranged in the correct order from youngest to oldest average surface age: Earth, Mars, Venus and Moon

## Earth's Interior
- The average density (about ${5.5g}/{cm^{2}}$) indicates that the interior is made up of material denser than rock
- The metallic core (inner solid and outer liquid core), a dense rocky mantle, and a thin, low-density crust
- The liquid outer core generates Earth's magnetic field through the dynamo effect
- A mechanism by which a celestial body such as the earth or a star generates a magnetic field. The dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid can maintain a magnetic field over astronomical time scales

### Seismic Waves
- Vibrations that travel through Earth's interior tell us what Earth is like on the inside

## Earth's Active Crust
Three important points about Earth's crust:
1. The motion of crustal plates produces much of the geological activity on Earth. The molten rock that emerges from volcanoes comes from the upper mantle
2. The continents of Earth's surface have moved and changed over periods of hundreds of millions of years. The youngest crust is near mid-ocean ridges and spreading zones
3. Most of the geological features on Earth are recent products of Earth's active surface

## Earth's Atmosphere
- The first (primary) atmosphere was rich in carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapour, hydrogen and methane
- As the earth cooled, carbon dioxide was scrubbed out by the oceans, leaving the atmosphere rich in other gasses, such as nitrogen and oxygen (due to photosynthesis)
- The atmosphere we breathe today is the secondary atmosphere
- An atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide can trap heat by a process called the greenhouse effect
- The CO2 added to the atmosphere by predominantly burning fossil fuels leads to the gradual increase in the surface temperature of the earth (global warming)

## Oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere
- When Earth was young, its atmosphere had no free oxygen
- ~2-2.5b years ago, plants began to rapidly produce oxygen via photosynthesis
- Carbon dioxide was scrubbed out by the oceans, leaving the atmosphere rich in other gases such as nitrogen and oxygen (due to photosynthesis)
- Ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere protects Earth from harmful UV rays. Visible and infrared only can pass through Ozone (O3)
- CFCs(chlorofluorocarbons), produced by humans, destroy ozone. Since the late 1970s, the O3 concentration has been decreasing

## A short geological history of the earth
1. Differentiation - the separation of each planet's material into layers according to density
2. Cratering and giant basin formation - could not begin until a solid surface formed
3. Slow surface evolution - has continued for at least the past 3.5b years


# Global Warming
## History of earth's climate
- life appeared 3.8 billion years ago
- Photosynthesis began 3.5-2.5 billion years ago
	- Produced oxygen and removed carbon dioxide and methane
	- Earth went through periods of cooling ("snowball earth") and warming
- Began cycles of glacial and interglacial periods ~3 million years ago

## Origin of the Atmosphere
- Earth had a primeval atmosphere from remaining gasses captured suiting the formation of earth
- Atmospheric composition was severely altered (secondary atmosphere) through a combination of two processes
	- Outgassing of compounds from the earth's interior
	- Bombardment of icy meteoroids and comets
## Today's atmosphere
- The ozone layer is essential in protecting Earth's surface from UV radiation
- Nitrogen, oxygen and argon are the 3 most abundant gasses in the Earth's atmosphere
## Common misconceptions
- Misconception: There is life on Earth because of oxygen
	- Truth:
		- Oxygen was not part of Earth's primeval atmosphere
		- there is oxygen in Earth's atmosphere because of life
		- Photosynthesis by plants is what keeps a steady supply of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere
- Misconception: The greenhouse effect is bad for Earth
	- Truths
		- Earth has always had a greenhouse effect
		- CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas
		- Also includes water vapour, methane and other gases
- Misconception: Ozone is bad
	- Truth: The ozone layer is what protects earth's surface from harmful UV radiation
- The observed warming of the earth is a result of natural causes rather than the greenhouse effect
	- Truths:
		- Natural causes should be driving temperatures to decrease, not increase
		- Sun's luminosity has remained constant
- Misconception: All of the earth will warm at the same rate
	- Truth:
		- N. America will be warm while Europe will become more wet and cool

## Households are big contributors to climate change
- 40% of all U.S greenhouse gas emissions come from households:
	- Vehicles
	- Home heating
	- Electricity

## How can we slow down global warming?
- Reduce consumption of fossil fuels
	- GHG emissions are tied very closely to our energy consumption, using less fossil fuel-based energy puts fewer GHGs into the atmosphere
	- This will help slow global warming
	- 50% of electricity in the United States is produced from coal
	- Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel

## Vehicle use in Canada
- The transportation sector is responsible for 27 percent of GHG emissions in Canada
- 19 million light-duty vehicles on the road
- Almost 1 vehicle for every 2 Canadians
- More than 300 billion kilometres driven per year
- Poor decisions and bad habits contribute to fuel waste

## Why do Canadians Idle?
- Most common reasons for idling in summer and winter:
	- Doing an errand
	- Stopping to talk to an acquaintance of a friend
	- Using restaurant drive-throughs or stopping for take-out food
	- waiting to get gas
	- stopping to use a cellular phone warming up a vehicle
	- waiting for someone

### How much do Canadians idle?
- Eight minutes a day in the peak of winter
- 75 million minutes per day nationally 

### Why idling is a problem
- Unnecessary vehicle idling:
- wastes a lot of fuel and money
- Depletes a valuable non-renewable resource
- Needlessly increases GHGs that contribute to climate change

## Impacts of climate change
- Increasing levels of GHGs are trapping heat in the atmosphere
- Global warming triggers changes in climate
- GHG emissions can magnify the effects of air pollution
- Air quality problems and health problems

Replacing 1 incandescent bulb with i CFL can save 150kg of carbon each year

## Long-term changes in climate
### Solar brightening
- The sun very gradually grows brighter with time, increasing the amount of sunlight warming the planets
### Changes in axial tilt
- Greater tilt creates more extreme seasons, while smaller tilt keeps polar regions colder
### Changes in reflectivity
- Higher reflectivity lead

## Escape velocity
Escape velocity math
$$V_{e}= \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$
Earth's escape velocity = 11.2km/s


## The moon: The view from the earth
- From Earth, we always see the same side of the moon
- The moon rotates around its axis in the same time that it takes to orbit around earth
- Tidal coupling: Earth's gravitation has produced tidal bulges

## The Origin of Earth's Moon
Three disproved hypotheses
1. The fission hypothesis - The moon broke off from a rapidly spinning proto-Earth
2. The condensation hypothesis - Earth and its Moon condensed from the same cloud of matter in the solar nebula
3. The capture hypothesis - The moon formed elsewhere in the solar nebula and was later captured by the earth
All of these hypotheses failed to go with the evidence

- The large-impact hypothesis suggests that the Moon formed when a planetesimal(small celestial body) estimated to have been at least as large as Mars, grazed the proto-earth
- The disk of ejected material coalesced to form the moon
- This hypothesis concerning the formation of the moon best fits the given data

## The history of Earth's moon
- Magma ocean
- Cratering and basin formation - Began as the crust solidified and meteors hit the surface
- The increased cater rate occurred during the *late heavy bombardment*

## Lunar geology
- Maria - Lunar lowlands filled by successive flows of dark lava
- Maria has very low [[Albedo]] (reflects only 6% of light)
- Highlands - Heavily cratered, lighter-coloured regions, composed of low-density rock, older than Maria
- Many rocks found on the Moon are [[Breccia | breaccis]]

![[Breccia]]

## Lunar surface features
Two dramatically different kinds of terrain
- Highlands
- Lowlands
### Highlands
- Sinuous rilles = remains of ancient lava flows
- May have been lava tubes which later collapsed due to meteorite bombardment

### Impact cratering
#### History of impact cratering
- Rates of impact decreased rapidly within the first 1/2 billion years after the formation of the solar system

## Human spaceflight
- Apollo 11, launched on July 16, 1969, successfully landed Neil Armstrong and Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969

## Missions to the Moon
Major challenges
- Need to carry enough fuel for
	- In-flight corrections
	- descent so surface
	- re-launch from the surface
	- return trip to earth
- need to carry enough food and other life support for ~ 1 week for all astronauts on board

## Mercury
Very similar to Earth's moon in several ways
- Small; no atmosphere
- Lowlands flooded by ancient lava flows
- heavily cratered surface

Until recently, most of our knowledge was based on measurements by Mariner 10 spacecraft (1974 - 1975).
### Rotation and revolution
- Revolution - 88 days
- Rotation - 59 days

### Interior
- Large metallic core
- 60% denser than Earth's moon
- The magnetic field is only ~0.5% of Earth's magnetic field
- Liquid metallic core should produce a larger magnetic field
- solid core should produce a weaker field

### History of mercury
- Only heavy elements could condense out 
- Later bombardment removed more of the light rocks from the mercury surface
- Not atmosphere -> heavy bombardment left many impact scratches
- Stronger gravity than the moon

## Venus
- The diameter is 95% of Earth's size and 30% closer to the sun
- Due to a *[[Runaway Greenhouse effect]]* on Venus, its surface is hidden below thick clouds. The surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead
- venus rotated backwards - The sun rises in the east and sets in the east
- A solar day that is 116.75 earth days long

### The atmosphere of Venus
- The atmosphere is very hot and dense
- Composition
	- 96% CO2
	- The rest is mostly nitrogen with some sulphur

### The surface of Venus
- Since the atmosphere is opaque to visible and infrared, radio waves are used to map the surface
- Radar maps reveal many smaller volcanoes, faults, and sunken regions produced when magma below the surface drained away
![[Coronae]]

### The history of venus
- May have had oceans when it was young, but it was warmer and CO2 in the atmosphere created a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet even warmer
- Volcanism appears to dominate the geology of Venus
- There is no plate tectonics, but there is evidence that convection currents below the crust are deforming the crust

## Mars
### The atmosphere of Mars
- 95% CO2, 3% nitrogen and 2% argon
- There is no ozone layer
- only about 1% as dense as Earth's atmosphere because it has a smaller escape velocity which lets most of its atmosphere escape
- Whatever water is present on Mars is frozen either within the polar caps or as permafrost in the soil

### Surface of mars
- Shows dichotomy - heavily cratered southern hemisphere and younger lowland northern hemisphere
- Evidence of volcanism(Tharsis region)
- All volcanoes are shield volcanoes
- rift valleys

### Searching for water on Mars
- Water once existed in large quantities on Mars
- Rovers have found clear evidence that liquid water flowed over the surface in some places
- Outflow channels and valley networks show evidence of water in the past
- Mars no longer has a magnetic field

### Magnetic field
- Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but the iron-core dynamo that generated it shut down billions of years ago leaving behind  only patches of magnetism due to magnetized minerals in the Martian crust

### History of Mars
- Differentiation into crust, mantle, and core
- The core cooled quickly and shut off the dynamo
- Cratering may have broken or at least weakened teh crust, triggering lava flows that flooded some basins
- Volcanoes may still occasionally erupt
- the age of liquid water must have been 3 billion years ago

### Phobos and Deimos
- Two irregularly shaped moods are likely captured asteroids
