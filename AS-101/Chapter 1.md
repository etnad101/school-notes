´´# The Scale of the Cosmos: Space and Time

## Goals
- Where are you and earth in the universe?
- How does the time span of human civilization compare with the universe?
- How does science give us a way to know about nature?

## Fundamental Questions of Modern Astronomy
- What makes up the universe?
- Where are we in the universe?
- What is the scale of the universe?
- How did we come to be?
- What is our motion in the Universe?

## Physics
Fundamental Science
- Concerned with the fundamental principles of the universe
- Foundation of other physical sciences
- Has simplicity of fundamental concepts

## Measurements
Used to describe natural phenomena
Each measurement is associated with a physical quantity
Need defined standards
Characteristics of standards for measurements:
- Readily accessible
- Possess dome property that can be measured reliably
- Must yield the same results when used by anyone anywhere
- Cannot change with time

## Standards of Fundamental Quantities

### Standardized systems
- Agreed upon by some authority, usually a governmental body

### SI - System International
- created in 1960

| Quantity            | Si Unit  |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Length              | Meter    |
| Mass                | Kilogram |
| Time                | Second   |
| Temperature         | Kelvin   |
| Electric Current    | Ampere   |
| Luminous Intensity  | Candela  |
| Amount of Substance | Mole     |

Second is defined in terms of the oscillation in radiation of a cesium atom.

| Power | Prefix | Abbr. |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 10^-9 | nano   | n     |
| 10^-6 | micro  | μ     | 
| 10^-3 | milli  | m     |
| 10^3  | centi  | c     |

### Fundamental Derived Units
- Area
	- A Product of two lengths
- Speed
	- Distance over Time
- Density

## Model Building

A model is a system of physical components
- useful when you cannot interact directly with the phenomenon
- Identifies the physical components
- Makes Predictions about the behaviour of the system
	- The predictions will be based on interactions among the components and/or based on the interactions between the components and the environment

## Units of Measure

![[Light-Year]]

![[Astronomical Unit]]

## Scale of the Universe

- The Atom
	- The nucleus of an atom is 10-billionth of a metre, where the nucleus of the atom is 10,000 times smaller than the atom itself
- Earth
	- Approximately 13,000 km in diameter
- Milky Way
	- approximately 80,000 [[Light-Year | Light-Years]] containing over 100 billion stars

*The temperature of interstellar space is about 2.4K and was discovered by the Canadian scientist Dr.McKellar in 1941*

## Basic Definitions

![[Planet]]

![[Star]]

![[Solar system]]

![[Galaxy]]

![[Spiral arms]]

*The moon is neither a star nor a [[Planet | planet]]. For scientists, the moon is simply an astronomical body*

## The Scientific Method & Theory
- The scientific method
	- The process by which scientists form hypotheses and test them against evidence gathered by experiment and observation
- A hypothesis is a suggestion about how nature works, and the evidence is reality
- When a hypothesis is compared with evidence and confirmed then it becomes a theory

Scientific theories:
- must be testable
- must be continually tested
- should be simple
- should be elegant

Scientific theories can be proven wrong, but they can never be proven right with 100% certainty.

- Theory leads to predictions consistent with previous observations

## Speed of the Rotation of Earth


	Radius at the equator  
	R = 6,371.14 km  
	Time=24 hrs  
	Circumference= 2πR  
	=2 * 3.14 * 6371.14 =40,010.7592 
	=40 010.76 km  
	Speed ~= 1600 km/hr
