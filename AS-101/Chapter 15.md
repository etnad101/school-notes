# Life on Other Worlds
## On Earth, all life:
- Extracts energy from its surroundings
- Maintains itself
- Modifies its surroundings for its survival
- Reproduces
- Evolves by natural selection
OR     
- Is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution

## The physical basis of life
- Carbon
	- Can form long and stable chains capable of storing a lot of information
	- The basis of life on earth
- Amino acids
- Proteins

## Information Storage and Duplication
- The chemical recipes of life are stored in each cell as information on DNA molecules
- The recipe information is expressed by the sequence of ladder rungs
- DNA instructions normally are expressed by being coped into a messenger molecule called RNA
- The instructions stored in DNA re genetic information passed to offspring

## The Origin of Life on Earth
- Oldest fossils are the remains of sea creatures, this indicates life began in the sea
- Indicates that simple organisms began 3.4billion years ago
