- When a large star has burnt all its fuel, it explodes into a supernova
- The stuff that is left collapses down to an extremely dense object known as a neutron star
- We know these exist because several have been observed with radio telescopes
- Formed from the collapsed remnant of a massive star, consists mostly of neutrons and very hot
- Typical mss between 1.35 and 2.0 solar mass with corresponding radius between 10 and 20km
