# Comparative Planetology of the Jovian Planets
## Physical characteristics
- Hydrogen-rich atmospheres
- near their centers have cores of dense material (rock and metal). They have no solid surface
- Have numerous moons, some of which are geologically active
- Have rings

## Jupiter
- ~5 [[AU]] from the sun
- Most of Jupiter's interior is liquid metallic hydrogen, which in conjunction with rapid rotation derives the strong magnetic field
- Emits about twice as much energy as it absorbs from the sun due to heat left over from the formation of the planet
- Jupiter is only 1.3x denser than water

### Jupiter's atmosphere
1. A pattern of coloured cloud bands circling the planet is called belt-zone circulation (similar to high and low-pressure areas in the Earth's atmosphere). Cyclones were discovered at the South Pole 
2. The positions of the cloud layers
3. The extensive magnetosphere is responsible for aurorae around the magnetic poles. Interactions between Jupiter's magnetic field and the solar wind generate electric currents that flow around the planet's magnetic poles
4. Jupiter's rings are relatively close to the planet

### Jupiters rings
- Very dark and reddish, indicating they consist of rocky material
- The forward scattering of visible light indicates that the rings are mostly made of extremely small grains
- The rings orbit inside the Roche limit where tidal forces are strong

### Jupiters moons
- 4 large moons
	- Io
	- Europa
		- Size of earths moon
	- Ganymede
	- Callisto
- 63 smaller moons
## Saturn
- Density = $0.69g/cm^{3}$
- rich in hydrogen and helium
- less Liquid metallic hydrogen than Jupiter, consequently a weaker magnetic field
- Radiates more energy than it receives from the sun

### Saturns rings
- Made up of billions of ice particles
- Particles can't be as old as Saturn
- Must be replenished now and then by impacts with Saturn's moons or other processes
	- The same is true of the rings around the other Jovian planets
- The gravitational effects of small moons can confine some rings in narrow strands or keep the edges of the rings sharp
- Moons can also produce waves in the rings that are visible as tightly wound ringlets
- The ring particles are confined in a thin layer in Saturn's equatorial plane, spread among  small moons and confined by gravitational interactions with larger moons
- The rings of Saturn and other Jovian planets are created and controlled by the planet's moons
- Without moons, there would be no rings

### Saturn Family of Moons
- Saturn has more than 60 moons
- Most moons are small, composed of mixtures of ice and rock, heavily cratered, and have no atmosphere
- Many are probably captured objects
- The biggest moon is Titan

#### Titan
- A dense atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen and traces of methane and argon
- Methane exists as liquid, gas and solid
- Methane is replenished through methane volcanoes
- There are ethane lakes
- Liquid methane falls as rain on titan
- A bit larger than Mercury

## Uranus
- The coldest atmospheric temperature in the solar system at 48K
- Not likely to contain any liquid metallic hydrogen
- The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium traces of methane absorb red light and make the atmosphere look blue
- Uranus is radiating about the same amount of energy that it receives from the sun
- The magnetic field is highly inclined to Uranus's axis of rotation
- 27 moons
### Rings
- Water ice bodies a mixed with methane and little dust

## Neptune
- Similar in composition to Uranus
- 14 moons
	- 2 Largest moons: Nereid and Triton
	- Triton orbits Neptune backwards
### Rings
- Narrow and well-defined
- Dark and faint

#remember
## What defines a planet?
One of the criteria for planet status developed by the International Astronomical Union is that: An object must be large enough to dominate and gravitationally clear its orbital region of most or all other objects

Eris and Pluto, the largest objects found so far in the Kuiper belt, and Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, do not meet that standard

## Pluto
- Small icy world, with a highly inclined orbit
- Is a large heart-shaped plain (1600km) surrounded by cratered terrain

### Atmosphere
- Has a thin atmosphere composed of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with small amounts of methane

### Moons
- Has 5 moons
- The largest moon is Charon
- Pluto and Charon are tidally locked

## Ceres
- A dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt
- About 1000km in diameter, low density
- NASA's Dawn spacecraft began orbiting Ceres to examine its shape and elemental composition in 2015
