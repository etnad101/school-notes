# Comparative Planetology of the Jovian Planets
## Physical characteristics
- Hydrogen-rich atmospheres
- near their centers have cores of dense material (rock and metal). They have no solid surface
- Have numerous moons, some of which are geologically active
- Have rings

## Jupiter
- ~5 [[AU]] from the sun
- Most of Jupiter's interior is liquid metallic hydrogen, which in conjunction with rapid rotation derives the strong magnetic field
- Emits about twice as much energy as it absorbs from the sun due to heat left over from the formation of the planet
- Jupiter is only 1.3x denser than water

### Jupiter's atmosphere
1. A pattern of coloured cloud bands circling the planet is called belt-zone circulation (similar to high and low-pressure areas in the Earth's atmosphere). Cyclones were discovered at the South Pole 
2. The positions of the cloud layers
3. The extensive magnetosphere is responsible for aurorae around the magnetic poles. Interactions between Jupiter's magnetic field and the solar wind generate electric currents that flow around the planet's magnetic poles
4. Jupiter's rings are relatively close to the planet

### Jupiters rings
- Very dark and reddish, indicating they consist of rocky material
- The forward scattering of visible light indicates that the rings are mostly made of extremely small grains
- The rings orbit inside the Roche limit where tidal forces are strong

### Jupiters moons
- 4 large moons
	- Io
	- Europa
		- Size of earths moon
	- Ganymede
	- Callisto
- 63 smaller moons
## Saturn
- Density = $0.69g/cm^{3}$
- rich in hydrogen and helium
- less Liquid metallic hydrogen than Jupiter, consequently a weaker magnetic field
- Radiates more energy than it receives from the sun

### Saturns rings
- Made up of billions of ice particles
- Particles can't be as old as Saturn
- Must be replenished now and then by impacts with Saturn's moons or other processes
	- The same is true of the rings around the other Jovian planets
- The gravitational effects of small moons can confine some rings in narrow strands or keep the edges of the rings sharp
- Moons can also produce waves in the rings that are visible as tightly wound ringlets
