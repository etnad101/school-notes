# The Solar Neighbourhood
- The nearest star to the sun is Proxima Centauri
- Member of a 3-star system known as the "Alpha Centauri Complex"

If the sun is a marble, Earth is a grain of sand orbiting 1m away. 
Proxima Centauri is another marble 270km away. 
The solar system extends out ~50m from the sun

## Luminosity and apparent brightness
- Luminosity or absolute brightness is a measure of the total power radiated by a star
- Apparent brightness is how bright a star appears when viewed from earth
	- Depends on the absolute brightness and the distance of the star

$${Apparent\ Brightness}\propto\frac{luminosity}{brightness^2}$$

- Light energy spreads out over an ever larger area, so it spreads out more thinly or diluted as it expands
- Therefore, two stars that appear equally bright might be a closer dimmer star, and a farther, brighter one

## Stellar temperatures
- The colour of a star is indicative of its temperature
- Red stars are relatively cool
- Blue stars are hotter

## Stellar Sizes
A few very large, very close stars can be imaged directly using speckle interferometry
For the vast majority of stars, size must be calculated knowing luminosity and temperature

$${luminosity} = radius^{2} \times temperature^{4}$$

- Giant stars have radii between 10 and 100 times the sun
- Dwarf stars have radii equal to or less than the Sun's size
- Supergiant stars have radii more than 100 times the Sun's

![[White Dwarf]]

L dwarfs (Brown dwarfs) - Cooler and fainter than M stars (red dwarfs)
T dwarfs - Even fainter
Y dwarfs - Extremely faint, temperatures below 500k

## Luminosity, Temperature,  and Diameter
- The Herzsprung-Russel diagram is a plot of luminosity vs surface temperature
- Important graph in astronomy because it sorts the stars into categories by size
- Approximately 90% of stars can be found in the main sequence

## The Chandrasekhar Limit
The Chandrasekhar Limit of 1.4 solar masses, is the theoretical maximum mass a white dwarf star can have and still remain a white dwarf

Above this mass, the star collapses further into a neutron star or a black hole

## Neutron Stars
- When a large star has burnt all its fuel, it explodes into a supernova
- The stuff that is left collapses down to an extremely dense object known as a neutron star
- We know these exist because several have been observed with radio telescopes
- Formed from the collapsed remnant of a massive star, consists mostly of neutrons and very hot
- Typical mss between 1.35 and 2.0 solar mass with corresponding radius between 10 and 20km
