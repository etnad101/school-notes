# The Solar Neighbourhood
- The nearest star to the sun is Proxima Centauri
- Member of a 3-star system known as the "Alpha Centauri Complex"

If the sun is a marble, Earth is a grain of sand orbiting 1m away. 
Proxima Centauri is another marble 270km away. 
The solar system extends out ~50m from the sun

## Luminosity and apparent brightness
- Luminosity or absolute brightness is a measure of the total power radiated by a star
- Apparent brightness is how bright a star appears when viewed from earth
	- Depends on the absolute brightness and the distance of the star

$${Apparent\ Brightness}\propto\frac{luminosity}{brightness^2}$$

- Light energy spreads out over an ever larger area, so it spreads out more thinly or diluted as it expands
- Therefore, two stars that appear equally bright might be a closer dimmer star, and a farther, brighter one

## Stellar temperatures
- The colour of a star is indicative of its temperature
- Red stars are relatively cool
- Blue stars are hotter

## Stellar Sizes
A few very large, very close stars can be imaged directly using speckle interferometry
For the vast majority of stars, size must be calculated knowing luminosity and temperature

$${luminosity} = radius^{2} \times temperature^{4}$$

- Giant stars have radii between 10 and 100 times the sun
- Dwarf stars have radii equal to or less than the Sun's size
- Supergiant stars have radii more than 100 times the Sun's

![[White Dwarf]]

L dwarfs (Brown dwarfs) - Cooler and fainter than M stars (red dwarfs)
T dwarfs - Even fainter
Y dwarfs - Extremely faint, temperatures below 500k

## Luminosity, Temperature,  and Diameter
- The Herzsprung-Russel diagram is a plot of luminosity vs surface temperature
- Important graph in astronomy because it sorts the stars into categories by size
- Approximately 90% of stars can be found in the main sequence

## The Chandrasekhar Limit
The Chandrasekhar Limit of 1.4 solar masses, is the theoretical maximum mass a white dwarf star can have and still remain a white dwarf

Above this mass, the star collapses further into a neutron star or a black hole

## Neutron Star
![[Neutron Star]]

## Black Hole
![[Black Hole]]

- The most important feature of a black hole is the [[Event Horizon]]
- The "interior" is the region inside the event horizon
- The "exterior" is outside the event horizon

Neutron stars cannot exist with masses > 3 solar masses, otherwise, it will collapse into a black hole

## Dark Matter and Dark Energy
- Dark makes up most of the mass of galaxies and galaxy clusters
- Responsible for the way galaxies are organized on a grand scale

- Dark energy is the name we give the mysterious influence driving the accelerated expansion of the universe

## Interstellar Matter
- The interstellar medium consists of gas and dust
- Gas is atoms and small molecules, mostly hydrogen and helium
- Dust is larger clumps of particles
- Dust absorbs light, and reddens the light that gets through

## Star-forming regions
- Nebula is a general term used for fuzzy objects in the sky
- Dark Nebula: Dust cloud
- Emission Nebula: Glows due to hot stars

## Formation of stars like the sun
- The gravitational force of a few atoms is nowhere near strong enough to overcome the random thermal motion
Stars go through a number of stages in the process of forming an interstellar cloud

### Stage 1
- Interstellar cloud starts to contract, probably triggered by shock or pressure wave from a nearby star
- As it contracts, the cloud fragments into smaller pieces

### Stage 2
- Individual cloud fragments begin to collapse
- Once the density is high enough, there is no further fragmentation

### Stage 3
- The interior of the fragment has begun heating as is about 10,000K

Planetary formation has begun, the the protostar is not in equilibrium. All heating comes from gravitational collapse

### Stage 6
- Core reaches 10 Million K and nuclear fusion begins
- The protostar has become a star

### Stage 7
- The star continues to contract and increase the temperature until it is in equilibrium
- The star has reached the *Main Sequence* and will remain there as long as it has hydrogen to fuse in its core

If the mass of the original nebular fragment is too small, nuclear fusion will never begin. These "failed stars" are called brown dwarfs.

Since a single interstellar cloud can produce many stars of the same age and composition, star clusters are an excellent way to study the effect of mass on stellar evolution
