- The universe has no edge or center
- The universe is 13.6 billion years old

![[Cosmology]]

## The necessity of a beginning
- Olber's paradox = the conflict between theory and evidence regarding the darkness of the night sky
- Observable universe = The part of the universe you can see from your location in space and time. The limits of the observable universe are due to its age

## Cosmic Expansion
### Hubble
- in 1929, Edwin Hubble published his discovery that the sizes of galaxy redshifts are proportional to galaxy distances (Hubble Law)
- suggests that the observable universe is expanding
- The universe is thought to have originated from a singularity
	- This theory came from observing the redshift of galaxies
	- Known as the Big Bang Theory
	- This is the currently accepted model

### Why is our view of the universe limited?
limits to what we can observe are set by 3 things:
1. The rate of expansion
2. The time since the Big Bang (age)
3. The speed of light

## The History of the atoms in your body
- The matter in our solar system formed during the Big Bang
- Atoms heavier than helium formed in successive generations of stars
- Our solar system may exist because of a supernova explosion that occurred about 4.6 billion years ago

## The origin of the solar system
- Solar nebula theory - A theory of the formation of the solar system consistent without current observations that describes how a rotating cloud of gas and dust gravitationally collapsed and flattened into a disk around the sun forming at the center and the planets forming around it.
- Earth and the other planets of our solar system formed billions of years ago as teh sun condensed from the interstellar medium.

Condensation theory - interstellar dust grains help cool clouds, and act as condensation nuclei

- A cloud of dust formed in a nebula
- Sometime the cloud of dust collapsed
- When it collapsed, it fell in on itself creating a disk of material surrounding it
- Gravity pulls dust together
- as it gets pulled together, the rotation speeds up (conservation of angular momentum)
- Temperature and pressure rise continually to ~(1 000 000ÂºC) resulting in nuclear fusion creating the sun
- The sun used more than 99% of the stuff in the disk
- The material left over clumped up because of gravity. Eventually, they got big enough to form planets and dwarf planets
- The accumulation through gravity is called accretion
- A particle grows by condensation when it adds matter one atom at a time from surrounding gas
## An inventory of the solar system
- we used to only know the moon, stars, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, comets, and meteors
- we now know the solar system has 135 moons, one star, nine planets, asteroids, comets and meteoroids

The distance from the sun is known from Kepler's laws
An orbital period can be observed
radius is known from the angular size
masses are from newtons laws
rotation period from observations
density is calculated knowing the radius and mass

All orbits except Pluto and Mercury are close to the same plane

### Terrestrial planets
- Earth-like planets made up of rocks or metals with a hard surface
- have a molten heavy-metal core, few moods and topological features such as valleys, volcanoes and craters
### Jovian planets
- Very large plants comprised of gas, rather than solid rock
- refer to a group of four planets in the solar system also known as gas giants
- gigantic compared to Earth, and have a gaseous nature like Jupiter

### Pluto
- Neither terrestrial nor jovian
- Relatively small terrestrial body
- Charon is the largest of Pluto's five moons
#remember
- Pluto-Charon is our solar system's only known double planetary system
- the same surfaces of Charon and Pluto always face each other, a phenomenon called mutual tidal locking
