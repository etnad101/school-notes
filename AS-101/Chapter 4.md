# Light

![[Radiation]]

## Interaction of light with matter
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Transmission
- Absorption
- Emission

## Thermal radiation
- nearly all dense objects emit thermal radiation, including stars, planets and people
- radiation emitted by an opaque object is called blackbody radiation

Wein's law - the hotter an object is, the shorter the wavelength of its maximum intensity
Stefan-Boltzmann law - hotter objects emit more energy than cooler objects of the same size

The wavelength of maximum intensity = the wavelength at which a perfect radiator emits the maximum amount of energy. Depends only on the temperature of the object

## law of conservation of energy
- equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- The total amount of energy in the universe is fixed
- energy can be transformed from one form to another, but the total amount of energy must remain unchanged

## Spectroscopy
- The process of dispersing light into its spectrum (different wavelengths)
- A spectrograph is a device that separates light into a spectrum using a prism or grating

## Telescopes
Three powers of telescopes
1. Light-gathering power
	- Amount of light a telescope can gather/take in
	- Depends on the surface area (A) of the primary lens/mirror, proportional to the diameter squared
2. Resolving power
	- Ability to separate 2 closely spaced lights. The human eye has a resolution of about 1 arc minute
	- The inverse of angular separation or distance between two objects when viewed via an optical instrument
3. Magnifying power
	- ability of the telescope to make the image appear bigger
	- depends on the ratio of focal lengths of the primary mirror/lens and the eyepiece
### Interferometry
A way to improve resolving power is to connect two or more telescopes in an interferometer
### Seeing
Weather conditions and turbulence in the atmosphere set further limits to the quality of astronomical images

### Two kinds of telescopes
1. Reflecting telescope
	- Uses mirrors to focus the image/light
2. Refracting telescope
	- Uses lenses to focus the image/light

### Observatories on earth
- Light pollution from cities and outdoor lighting prevents the observation of faint objects
- Telescopes on Earth must continuously move to compensate for Earth's rotation (sidereal tracking)

### Optical infrared and sub-millimeter telescopes
Optical = visible light
infrared = infrared
submillimeter = <1mm wavelength

### Hubble vs JWST

### More space telescopes
- Kepler telescope - Looked for Earth-like planets around other stars
- Hershel Space Observatory - Observed from behind a sunscreen
- Chandra X-ray observatory - Orbits a third of the way to the moon

### Gamma-Ray telescopes
- Compton Gamma-ray Observatory - mapped the entire sky at gamma-ray wavelengths
