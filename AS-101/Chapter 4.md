# Light

![[Radiation]]

## Interaction of light with matter
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Transmission
- Absorption
- Emission

## Thermal radiation
- nearly all dense objects emit thermal radiation, including stars, planets and people
- radiation emitted by an opaque object is called blackbody radiation

Wein's law - the hotter an object is, the shorter the wavelength of its maximum intensity
Stefan-Boltzmann law - hotter objects emit more energy than cooler objects of the same size

The wavelength of maximum intensity = the wavelength at which a perfect radiator emits the maximum amount of energy. Depends only on the temperature of the object

## law of conservation of energy
- equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- The total amount of energy in the universe is fixed
- energy can be transformed from one form to another, but the total amount of energy must remain unchanged

## Spectroscopy
- The process of dispersing light into its spectrum (different wavelengths)
- A spectrograph is a device that separates light into a spectrum using a prism or grating

## Temperature and heat
