# Lecture 1: Economic & political dimensions of sustainability
## Income equity in Canada
- 10% of Canadian adults own 35% of Canada's total wealth
- The bottom 50% of Canadian adults (as measured by wealth) on less than 10% of Canada's total wealth

## Wealth distribution in Canada
- 20% of Canadian households have a net worth of > $1 million

## How is household net worth calculated?
- Sum of asset: savings + investments + pension + life insurance
- Sum of liabilities
- Deduct liabilities from assets

## Canadian housing prices
- Housing prices skyrocketed during the pandemic and have fallen somewhat since 2022
- Interest rates have risen
- Nearly half of all household wealth in Canada is real estate
- Many people cannot afford to buy a home
- Many of those who bought a home during the pandemic are making higher mortgage payments for a home that's losing value

## Costs of finding a place to live
- To qualify for a mortgage in Toronto you need an annual income of $240,000 plus a down payment of $260,000
- Average price of a single-family home in Waterloo Nov 2023 = $890,000; in Toronto $1.3M
- The average cost to newly rent a 1 bedroom apt in Toronto in Nov 2023 = $2,600/month
- average 1 bedroom rend in Waterloo = $2000/month

## Economics 101 (sort of)
### Cost-benefit analysis of opening a pizza shop

| Costs                                                                            |     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Fixed costs: premises, equipment, financing                                      |     |
| Operating costs: employee wages, ingredients, pizza boxes, advertising, delivery |     |


### Valuing nature as a set of resources
- How much $ would the trees be worth as building material?
- Could we replace the forest with farmland?
- Could we build a ski resort on the mountain?
- Could we dam the river and sell hydroelectric power?
- Is there any gold or other valuable minerals in the river sediments?

### Applying a classical economics cost/benefit analysis to whales
- In 2008, there were 1.16M whale whale-watching visits in Canada
- In Quebec, the average whale watcher spent $142 per visit
- estimated $80M ($110M adjusted for inflation)

### Ecological economies
- A relatively new field emerged in the 1980s
- uses many of the same mathematical tools as traditional economics BUT

### Ecological goods and services
- A term used to describe the economic and cultural benefits provided to humans by ecosystems
Example: insect pllinaiton
- Many common food items require insect pollination
- We don't pay the insects anything
- But if we fail to protect them, we lose these crops
- In economics language: an externality

### Externalities
- Positive Externality = insects pollinate our food for free, everyone benefits
- Negative Externality = Automobile drivers pollute the air, everyone shares teh cost of air pollution

Make consumers/producers pay the full price of pollution
End subsidies for oil companies
Better labelling so that consumers can make knowledgeable choices
Ask governments to pass laws and regulations


## In Canada, who makes the laws & regulations with respect to the environment?
- It depends
- The Constitution Act allocated lawmaking responsibilities to federal and provincial governments
- Each level of government has its own responsibilities but they sometimes overlap

## Provinces delegate many responsibilities to cities and local governments
- Land use planning, housing developments, 

## Example: Taking action on climate change
- The federal government is responsible for making & acting upon international commitments to combat climate change
- Has legal power to impose taxes on Canadians, including a carbon tax

# Lecture 2: Economic and social exclusion from nature
## Environmental change & challenge in Ontario's cottage country (Addington Highlands)
### Community profile (2016)
- population 2,323
- Avereage age = 50
- 30% of the population is over 65
- Average household income = $57,600
- Roughly 1/4 of people in AH are considered to be "low income" by Canadian standards


### Child poverty in AH
- Symptoms of wider poverty among permanent residents
- >30% of students are fed breakfast and lunch by the school because they don't get decent meals at home
- Often visibly hungry & stressed in winter
- some spend 3 hours travelling to/from school each day

### Summer Tourism
- Consists of seasonal residents and vacationers
- Bon Echo provincial part attracts >150,000 visitors each summer

### Economic characteristics of AH
- Biggest employment sectors are construction; forestry, hunting & fishing; retailing; tourism services
- The economy is highly seasonal
- Many people who live there year-round work multiple low-wage jobs to make ends meet
- Many young adults, especially men, work elsewhere

### Summer economy
- Construction
- Providing goods and services to tourists

### Winter economy
- Not many jobs once the tourists stop coming after labour day
- Many retailers close after Thanksgiving, and reopen in May
- Small-scale forestry takes place in winter
- A few shops and restaurants provide goods and services to winter tourists

### Observed changes in climate in AH
- Winters are getting shorter, and less snowy on average
- A lot of year-to-year variability in climate
- Spring starts earlier
- Summer gets hotter and longer

### Impacts of summer climate trends
- Tourists and cottages love hot summer weather
- If it gets too hot and dry, a fire ban will be put in place
	- Discourages some campers from coming
- Wind damage becomes more frequent

### Impacts of winter climate trends
- Contractors can build or renovate cottages almost year-round
- Lake ice conditions are increasingly dangerous
- Snowmobiling conditions are not good
- Winter forestry season is shortened
- Loss of supplementary income from trapping
- Home heating costs may be lower in some years
- AH government must spend more money on road maintenance

### Addington Highlands dialectic
- During the pandemic, property prices went up as people moved out of the city

### Adapting to climate change in AH
- The positive benefits of climate change mostly go to cottagers
- The risks and adverse impacts mostly affect permanent residents
- The cottagers don't care what happens in AH in winter
- Permanent residents and local governments lack $ to adapt
- Cottagers complain about paying property tax on their cottages

### Future prospects for AH
- The climate is changing rapidly
- Young people are leaving and not coming back
- Building adaptive capacity in this region requires improving year-round economic development and cooperation

## Social exclusion from nature
- Not everyone has the same opportunity to interact with and experience nature
- 2016 study in the UK found that children in low-income and non-white households have significantly less outdoor activity in natural areas


#remember 
## Complete solutions: agrarian wisdom
- Wendell Berry, 1934

### "Solving for pattern"
- A term coined by Berry to describe the process of finding solutions that solve multiple problems, while minimizing the creation of new problems
- People and institutions rarely do this
- Instead, we try to solve one problem at a time, without thinking of feedback effects

### A complete solution according to Wendell Berry
- A solution to a problem that doesn't create new problems
