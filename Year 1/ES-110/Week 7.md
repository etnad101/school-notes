# Lecture 1: Climate Change Causes and Impacts
## Part 1: How climate works
### Weather vs climate
![[Weather]] 

![[Climate]]


Climate processes are driven by solar radiation
### Energy Balance
- Over the long term, the amount of solar energy coming into the atmosphere must be equal to the amount leaving the Earth's atmosphere
- Incoming 
	- solar radiation averages $342W/m^{2}$
- Outgoing
	- reflected off tops of clouds and shiny surfaces back to space = 107 W/m^2
	- Absorbed by gasses in the atmosphere = 67 W/m62
	- Absorbed by Earth surgace = 168 W/m^2
	- This 235 W/m^2 gets re-radiated back into space
- Incoming = Outgoing

### The greenhouse effect
- naturally occurring process that moderates the earth's surface temperature, making it warmer than it otherwise would be
- Creates a range of surface temperatures suitable to living creatures

#### How it works
- Certain gases found in trace amounts in the atmosphere, trap, absorb and re-radiate long-wave radiation
- These gases cause the greenhouse effect and are called greenhouse gases (GHGs)

#### GHGs and their concentrations
- Water vapour (about 1% of total atmospheric volume but varies considerably over time and pace)
- Carbon dioxide (415ppm)
- Methane (1.91ppm)
- Nitrous oxide (0.336)
- CFCs (.001 ppm)

### Oceans help redistribute heat around the globe
- More incoming solar radiation arrives at the equator than at other poles
- Ocean currents help redistribute the heat

Fort Severn avg temp = -14ºC
Glasgow avg temp = 7ºC
North Atlantic drift is a surface current that brings warm water from the tropics to the NW coast of Europe
Gives the UK, and Scandinavia warmer climates than Canada on the same latitude

### Hottest years
- The hottest years on record have all occurred since 2010
- Instrumentally recorded temperature records date back to the mid-1800s

### Factors that influence the climate
- The Earth's orbit
	- Causes seasonal changes throughout the year

#### Milankovitch variations
- Earth's orbit is an ellipse that varies (~100,000 years)
- The angle of the tilt of the earth varies over time (~40,000 years)
- The earth wobbles on its axis (~26,000 years)

These cycles added together influence the solar distribution on the earth
These are the causes of ice ages

#### Fluctuations in solar activity also affect climate
e.g. sunspots
- The amount of radiation the Earth receives from the sun is generally consistent
- Occasionally there are sunspots/solar flares that temporarily increase the amount of radiation the Earth receives

#### Volcanic activity affects climate
- Produces large amounts of smoke, particulates that temporarily block incoming radiation, cool the climate
- Can also produce greenhouse gasses that warm the climate
- Not a lot of volcanic activity in the last two centuries

#### Naturally Occurring factors are not responsible
- Average global temperatures would be roughly the same today as they were in 1850 if volcanos, solar flares, and Milankovitch cycles were the only factor
- Human activities are responsible for global warming

###  Where is carbon stored?
- Atmosphere in gasses
- Biomass
- fossilized
- dissolved in oceans

Humans are redistributing the natural storage of carbon by doing things like burning fossil fuels and making cement

### Carbon sinks
- Land vegetation, ocean direct absorption, and plankton remove the amount of carbon from the air
- Human activity makes more carbon than these carbon sinks can naturally remove from the air

# Lecture 2: Future risks of climate change

## Physical impacts of climate change
- Average temperatures will continue to rise
- precipitation patterns will change in many regions
- amount of snow and ice will decline
- sea levels will continue to rise 
- oceans will become more acidic

- Future increases in temperature will not be evenly distributed
- some regions will heat up more than others
- Warming will be stronger in the Arctic and on land in the northern hemisphere
- Some areas will become drier and some will become wetter
- Precipitation will increase in high latitudes,

### How cyclones form
- Tropical cyclones/hurricanes form over oceans when sea surface temperatures > 26,5ºC
- The severity is higher as the water gets warmer
- Sea surface temperatures are rising providing additional energy for storms
- Direct correlation between sea surface temperatures and severity of storms

- The severity of tropical cyclones is expected to increase in East Asia
- In North America the season when we get tornadoes and severe thunderstorms is increasing

### Droughts
- Drought frequency severity is linked to sea surface temperatures and global precipitation patterns
- Higher average temperatures increase evapotranspiration rates putting plants under greater stress

### Arctic sea ice
- Arctic sea ice disappears in the summer

- It does not change sea level
- Has impacts on arctic wildlife
- Reflects sunlight into space, reducing global temperature

#### Sea levels are rising
-  between 1990 and 2000 global average sea level rise was ~2cm
- between 2010 and 2020 global sea level rise is approximately 5cm
- Currently on a pathway to +50-60cm by 2100

#### Why does sea level rise
- The volume of water increases as it gets warmer (thermal expansion)
- Water from melted ice on land drains into the oceans
- Ice sheets are melting

### Permafrost is melting
- In northern regions, the ground is frozen for much or all year
- As temperatures increase, more ground starts to melt
- Arctic buildings built on permafrost start to collapse as the ground melts

### Ocean acidification
- More CO2 in the air leads to more carbonic acid in the ocean increasing overall acidity
- Barnacles and clams have a tough time surviving in acidic water
- Reef-building corals die if water becomes too warm, too cloudy or too acidic
- reef bleaching events are increasing in frequency 

## Vulnerability & adaptation to climate change (with a focus on sea level rise)

### Vulnerability to climate change
- Vulnerability = potential to experience loss or harm

Is a function of
- The nature of the physical changes to which a population is exposed
- the sensitivity of that population to climatic variability & change
- The adaptive capacity of that population
#### How many people are at risk
- ~400m people worldwide live in coastal areas exposed to sea level rise, flooding, and other hazards by 2100
- 88m live in areas that would be underwater in 2100 in high emissions scenario
- in the us, ~7m people would live in highly exposed coastal areas by 2060

#### Sensitivity to sea level rise
- Sensitivity reflects land use, livelihood types
	- Substinence fishing village = higher sensitivity
	- Golf course owned & used by wealthy people for recreation = lower sensitivity (just move the greens)
#### Adaptive capacity
- The ability to cope with and adjust to climatic availability & change
- Adaptation can happen at all scales (local to global)
- adaptation can be proactive (in anticipation of risk) or reactive (after harm has occurred)
- How you adapt is often a function of your wealth, access to technology

#### Relative vulnerability to sea level rise
- The exposure & sensitivity are similar for Holland and Bangladesh
- both countries are situated on the coast and low sea level
- The adaptive capacity of Holland is very different than Bangladesh due to wealth inequalities

#### Vulnerability of coastal communities and small island states to sea level rise
- Gradual inundation of low-lying areas
- Flooding from high tides and heavy rainfall events
- Deeper inland penetration of storms and storm surges
- Salinization of groundwater and water used for crops

#### Adaptation options for sea level rise
- Create early-warning systems & evacuation plans for storms
- Build protective walls
- put buildings on stilts
- Build artificial islands
- Assist people in relocation from high-risk areas
