# Lecture 1: Protecting Forests
## Origins of trees
- First began appearing 350m years ago
- hominids first appeared ~6m years ago

### Oldest living things
- A bristlecone pine in white mountains california is 5000 years old

### How do we know how old a tree is
![[Dendrochronology]]

### Largest living single organism
- Giant sequoia
- 2,200 years old

### Tallest living thing
- California coastal redwoods, *Sequoia sempervemins*
- largest specimen 122.5m height

## What is a forest
![[Forest]]

### Characteristics of forest biomes
- Higher levels of precipitation
- Higher levels of production of organic material
- High levels of biodiversity
- Low levels of soil erosion

### Taiga or boreal
- Relatively low biodiversity
- Needles are difficult to digest
- Most trees are coniferous

### Mixed forest Ontario
- Higher biodiversity than taiga

### Eastern broad-leaf deciduous forest
- Biodiversity increases even more
- the forest extends to Carolinas

### Pacific Coast temperate rainforest
- Higher levels of biodiversity than taiga
- Green year-round

### Tropical rainforest
- Tremendous biodiversity
- A single tree in Peru was found to contain 43 species of ants (~100 ant species in all of  Canada)
- A single hectare of forest in Ecuador was found to contain 473 different tree species

### Tropical deciduous forests
- Characteristic of monsoonal climates (i.e. climates with distinct rainy and dry seasons)
- Vegetation goes dormant and loses its leaves in the dry season

## Types of trees
- Coniferous trees = have cones
- Broadleaf trees = have leaves
- Deciduous trees = trees that go dormant for part of the year, lose their leaves or needles
- Evergreen = tree that does not go dormant, maybe a tree with leaves or needles

## Forest Statistics
- ~1/3 of the earth's land surface is forested
- A temperate forest contains 605 of the biomass of a tropical forest
- Humans have removed ~1/2 of the world's forest cover
- Current forest clearance rates are highest in tropical regions
- Deforestation results when forests are not allowed to regenerate after harvesting

## Forest disturbance
- Disturbance =  any events that stimulate changes in the size, structure or composition of a forest
- can be natural or anthropogenic
- in some instances, periodic disturbance is required to maintain the health of the forest
- Forestry & deforestation are types of disturbance

### Disturbance by insects
- Bark-burrowing beetles are a common pest in Canadian forests
- Cold winter temperatures are the main limiting factor for these beetles
- Warming temperatures allow beetles to multiply and spread
- Huge areas of western forest are now dying as a result.

### Disturbance by invasive species
- Ash trees in Ontario and elsewhere are currently being decimated by emerald ash borers

### Fire disturbance
- Forest fires are a common, natural phenomenon in the mountains of western North America & the boreal forest
- Fire creates a heterogeneous mix of species, age classes of trees
- Tree & plant species have adapted to fire

#### Impacts of fire-fighting
- Humans have actively suppressed fire in the West for the last century to save timber for future harvesting, protect homes, property
- Doing so interferes with ecosystem dynamics and elevates the risk of catastrophic fires

#### Forest fires in Canada
- Wildfires burned ~500% of the 10-year average in the summer of 2023
- The actual number of fires was only ~10% above average
- The size and intensity of the fires were much more
- This is due to a dryer and warmer climate

# Lecture 2: Sustainable forestry
## Forestry Industry in Canada
- generated C$24.6.b in revenue in 2018
- Forest sector employs >200k Canadians
- Canada is the world's largest exporter of forest products by $ value
- Most of our exports go to the USA

### 3 key sectors
1. Logging operations
2. Processing wood for building materials
3. Pulp and paper

### Non-timber forest products
- valuable forest products other than wood
	- Foods(e.g. maple syrup, mushrooms)
	- Medicinal compounds
	- Ornamental products
	- likely worth >C$350 million/year

### Forest management in Canada
- Over 90% of Canadian forests are on publicly owned ("Crown") land

## Three categories of forests from an economic perspective
- Primary forests = that have not been logged contain native species mix and have regenerated on their own (36% world forest cover)
- Production forest = have been logged at least once or are being actively logged (57% world forest cover)
-  Plantation forests = forests consisting primarily of commercial varieties that have been deliberately planted/seeded (7% world forest cover)  

### Global Primary forest stock
- Half are in developed countries, half in less developed
- only 20% in protected areas
- much of it is fragmented 
- the rate of net loss is about 0.5% per decade

## Forestry vs deforestation
Forestry = practice of harvesting trees to make use of the wood
 -When done skillfully it doesn't result in a long-term net loss of forest or forest diversity and can facilitate reforestation

Deforestation = cutting down trees and not allowing them to grow back
- Typically results in land being put to some other use

Aforestation = process of  increasing the net amount of forest in a given area

### Drivers of deforestation
- Differ by region
- In NA, EU, and Asia, Wildfires + commercial forestry are the main drivers
- In Africa, driven by small-scale subsistence agriculture
- In Latin America and Southeast Asia forests are cleared to make way for commercial agriculture (i.e. commercially based deforestation)

## North American deforestation
- European settlers cleared forests for timber for export
- and establishing farms
- Governments used to encourage settlers to clear forests

### 18th-century laws about trees
- Land grants to settlers in British North America typically required people to clear trees, cultivate a fixed acreage and build a house

### Canadian environmental management started with forests

### Canadian forest conservation
- 1882 Canada-US forest conference held in Montreal
- Quebec created the first national forest, in 1883  
- Banff made the first national park in 1887 to encourage CPR tourism  
- Algonquin Park created in 1893 as a forest preserve for harvesting

## Laurier and Canadian conservationism
- In 1906 Laurier organized a Canadian forest convention
- Began passing laws to protect forests

### Gale Pinchot
- Established yale school of forestry
- head of US Forest Service, 1898
- a firm believer that "wise use" was the key to saving forests

### Pinchot's 3 principles of conservation
1. Natural resources should be used for the benefit of people who live here now
2. Do not waste natural resources; efficient use is critical
3. Narual resources must be developed for the benefit of all people, not just a few

### Laurier's plan failed
- because not enough funding and WWI distracted them

### Conservation Goes out of Fashion
- In 1920, OM Arthur Meighen declared conservation to be outdated
- Said it locked up the country's resources
- Laurier's Commission for Conservation was disbanded

## Ecosystem Services provided by forests
- Trees prevent soil erosion
- protect rivers
- have high biodiversity
- provide fuel, building material
- take carbon from the atmosphere
	- A return flight from Waterloo-Calgary generates approximately 1/2 Tonne of CO2
	- 10-15 trees can remove 1 tonne of CO2 from the air over their lifetimes
	- Amazon rainforests account for 25% of all CO2 absorbed globally
- generate rain
- cool cities
- heal people
	- aesthetically pleasing
	- people become more relaxed around trees
	- Shinrin-yoku (forest bathing)
		- studies from Japan show that walking in the woods:
			- has psychological benefits
			- boosts your immune system
		- Forest bathing is now a popular activity in Japan

## Deforestation is dumb
- Short-term economic gain
- Long-term damage

## Sustainable forestry
- Sustainable forestry is increasingly practiced in Ontario

### Forest Management in Ontario
- Ontarios crown forests are organized into management units
- each unit has a formal ongoing planning process to determine how, when, and where to harvest
- the plan must also include steps to regenerate the forest after harvesting

### Forest management in Mazinaw-Lanark
- Mixed forest
- most forestry is conducted by family owned & operated business
- Hardwood trees are used for building materials, firewood

#### Recently "clear-cut" area in Mazinaw-Lanark
- mix of trees are left standing
- remaining trees hold soil on slope and provide trees
- offcuts that aren't used are left to provide seeds

#### Recently "selectively cut area"
- In winter a small section of trees in are harvested
- Method is. used in areas with slopes, other locations where forests might not regenerate successfully after clear-cutting

### Maple syrup harvesting
- efficient pipeline system collects sap from thousands of spiles
- Causes very little disturbance to forest
- Maintains high levels of biodiversity while producing a highly valuable product

### What sustainability looks like in terms of forest management
1. Protecting forests with unique ecological characteristics
2. Careful management of production forests to provide livelihoods, economic opportunities and preserve biodiversity
3. Avoiding forestry practices that damage soil, and water and prevent forests from regenerating

### What governments can do
- Insist upon sustainable forest management practices
- Monitor timber companies
- Enforce existing laws
- require labelling so consumers can know the source of products

### What individuals can do
- Reduce, reuse, recycle
- choose wood over plastic
- acoid products made from tropical wood
-
