## James Lovelock (1919-2022)
- PhD in medicine
- Pioneer in cryopreservation
- Invented the electron capture detector
- Discovered CFCs were harming the ozone layer
- Worked for NASA on Mars research
- Established the Gaia hypothesis

## What is the Gaia hypothesis
- All living organisms and non-living components of Earth(oceans, atmosphere, terrestrial systems) function collectively to form what is essential for a single, planetary-sized organism
- Compare it to the human body, which is a collection of many different types of cells, each with specific functions, that collectively work together to live and grow- and which draw upon air, water,plants, etc. to do so

## Implications of the Gaia Hypothesis
- When one part of the planetary system is not functioning properly, it can disrupt the stability of other parts or teh whole thing
- Other parts of the system will respond and correct the malfunctioning parts to return the planet to a more stable state
- Lovelock's concern: human activity is damaging the planet so rapidly and deeply that teh other systems are becoming drastically unstable, unpredictable
- Emphasized the need for sustainable development
