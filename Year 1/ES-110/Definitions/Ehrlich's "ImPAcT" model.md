I = P x A* x T

where

I = impact on the environment
P = population
A = affluence*
T = technology

*or C = consumption

# Implications of the ImPAcT model

1. A small, affluent and technologically advanced population will have a greater impact on the environment than a larger, poorer, less technologically advanced population
2. Within societies, smaller numbers of wealthier people, have larger impacts on the environment

# The impact Model assumes...

- Affluence always leads to higher levels of consumption of natural resources (or 'natural capital)
- Technology always leads to higher levels of consumption of natural resources


Being affluent does not mean you automatically have a hugely adverse impact on the environment
The Swedes are proving that you can be very wealthy and have low greenhouse gas emissions

# Utility of ImPAct model
- We can use the I = PAT* model throughout the course to reflect on how human activity affects the environment
