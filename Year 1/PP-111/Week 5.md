# Mind and Body   
# Lecture
## Common Sense view (A or B)
### A) Mind (Inner) and world (outer)
- Mind and its contents
- Mental images of physical objects and other people
Mind is a realm of things that are known directly, and with certainty

- The external world
- Physical objects and other people 
A realm of uncertainties, of things known (if at all) only indirectly, and without complete certainty
### B)  Cockroach video
## Some Metaphysical Theories of the Mind
- Dualism
	- Interactionist dualism
	- Epiphenomenalism
- Monism (Materialism)
	- Eliminative Materialism
	- Mind-Brain Identity Theory
		- Reductionist theory
		- acknowledges the mind exists but can be reduced to physical properties
	- Functionalism
### Mind / Body Dualism
- The mind is a nonphysical substance
- The body is a physical substance

A physical substance(entity) is anything which conforms to and can be explained by strict physical laws
A nonphysical substance is any substance (entity) that is not physical
Nonphysical substances have no physical (strict, law-governed) properties

#### Interactionism
Mind causes the body, body causes the mind
the body causes certain mental events, e.g. stubbing your toe causes pain
the decisions you make in your mind (mental), can cause you to control your body

### A Metaphysical Law
Leibnitz's Law ("Indiscernibility of Identicals"):
If A == B, then if A has a certain property (characteristic) at a given time then B must also have that same property ( characteristic) at that time
i.e. Nothing can be different from itself in any way
Consequence: If  has some property that B does not have, then A is not the same as B

### Descartes' Argument for the Separation of Mind and Body
1. That I exist can be known with complete certainty
2. That any physical object exists cannot be known with complete certainty
3. So, I cannot be any physical object
4. So, I must be a nonphysical object

### The Inconsistent Triad
1. Dualism: the body is physical and the mind is nonphysical
2. Interactionism: the mind affects the body, and the body affects the mind
3. Closure of Physical law: all physical changes or events have a complete physical explanation

What should we give up?
- closure of physical Law?
	- Flies in the face of too much evidence
	- need to give up science
- Dualism?
	- Minds are physical: "Materialism"
- Interactionism?
	- Minds cant affect bodies: "Epiphenomenalism"

## Arguments for Mind-Brain Identity
1. Feelings of amusement are perfectly correlated with increased electrochemical activity in the inferior temporal gyrus
	- Feelings of amusement and increased electrochemical activity in the inferior temporal gyrus have the same causes and the same effects: both are caused by jokes, and both cause smiling and laughter
	- Either: 
		- A: there are always two perfectly correlated causes of laughter
		- B: feelings of amusement are just increased electrochemical activity in the inferior temporal gyrus
	- Ockham's Razor: Choose the simplest explanation
2. Feelings of amusement are identical with increased electrochemical activity in the inferior temporal gyrus

# Tutorial
## Dualism - Material/Immaterial substances
- Cartesian Dualism - Two-way causality (Mind <-> Body)
- Epiphenomenalism - One-way causality (Body -> Mind)
	- Objection: If the mind is only a receiver, then it is useless
- Descartes - Can doubt the material world but not himself
	- Objection: Your ability to know/not know is only a feature of your

- Leibniz's Law - if A=B then on every occasion A must possess the qualities of B

## Three kinds of Materialism
1. Mind - Brain Identity
	- Reduces mental states/characteristics to brain states
2. Functionalism
	- Environmental input -> Behavioural output - (functional equivalence)
3. Eliminative Materialism
	- No "mind", All cause-effect
