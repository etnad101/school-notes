## Thomas Reid
- A person is something indivisible. This implies the continued existence of "myself"
- My thoughts, and actions and feelings, change every moment...but that self or I, to which they belong is permanent.
- We have a "natural conviction", an invincible belief" of our own identity and continued existence

## David Hume on the self
- Believes views on the self by thomas reid is incorrect
- "We feel its existence and its continuance in existence, and are certain ... both of its perfect identity and simplicity."

All knowledge comes from experience.
Our minds are a blank slate on which experience writes.

### Hume: The theatre of the mind
	"The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle. ... They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind."
(i) To be observed, the self must appear on stage
(ii) To observe itself, the Self must be in the audience
(iii) The self can never (simultaneously) be both observer and observed
(iv) so the self can never observe itself.

### Hume's Diagnosis
We have a natural propensity to confuse two different things:
1. "several different objects existing in succession and connected together by a close relation"
2. "an object that remains invariable and uninterrupted through ... time"

"The confusion and mistake .. makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead of that of related objects"

### Hume's "self"
- The supposedly unchanging "self" is merely a fiction, resulting from our confusion of "succession" and "identity"
- The real self is "nothing but <u>a bundle of different perceptions</u> which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity"
- "They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind"

## Gilbert Ryle
"I' is like my own shadow; I can never get away from it ... it seems to endow 'I' with a mystifying uniqueness and adhesiveness. 'Now' has something of the same besetting feeling."
