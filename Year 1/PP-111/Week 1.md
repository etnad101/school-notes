Bertrand Russel (1872-1970)
- Philosophy properly done can lead to seeing familiar things in an unfamiliar light


| sameness                | Difference             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| constancy (stability)   | Change (flux)          |
| persistance (endurance) | creation & destruction |

## Theseus' Ship

### Two views of change & sameness
1. They can be reconciled Some changes in an object can be so insignificant that they do not prevent it from being the same object after it has undergone such changes
2. They can't be reconciled: If an object changes, then it doesn't remain the same; and if it doesn't remain the same, then it is a different object

## Subscribing to the Incompatibility Thesis
- Early Materialists: The Flux
	- Thales (625-545 B.C.E)
	- Heraclitus (535-475 B.C.E)
Only matter (Earth, Air, Fire, Water), and what is composed of matter, exists

- Early Idealists: Constancy
	- Pythagoras (580-496 B.C.E)
	- Parmenides (540-470 B.C.E)
	- Zeno (489-430 B.C.E)
Reality is an ideal version of what we encounter in our experience


### Materialism: The Four Elements
Fire -> Air -> Water -> Earth
Heraclitus (Fire)

### The Idealists: Constancy

### An Argument from a Follower of Parmenides
The impossibility of change
- Change requires that something become what it is not
- But nothing can be what it is not
- so nothing can change
Zeno: The impossibility of motion

### Appearance & Reality
- Heraclitus:
	- Change (the flux), creation and destruction, are real and known via our sense of experience
	- Sameness, Constancy, and Persistance are illusory
- Parmenides:
	- Sameness, Constancy, and Persistence are real and are known by reason
	- Change, creation and destruction are not real, but illusory
Both agreed: Nothing can change in any way and remain the same

## Subscribing to the Compatibility Thesis
New Materialists: Democritus (460-370 B.C.E)
New Idealists:
	Plato (429-347 B.C)
	Aristotle (384-322 B.C) - recovers some of the aspects of our common sense view of change
