## Troubles for Reductive Materialism
- Reductive Materialism is Chauvinistic
- Multiple Realizability

## Functionalist Theory of the Mind
- A non-reductionist form of the materialist theory of the mind that allows for the same types of mental states to have different physical realizations (different physical constructions)
- Non-reductionist: "Amusement is sometimes increased electrical activity in the inferior temporal gyrus, some sometimes it is something else"
- Functional Roles (functional identities):
	- Professors (tall, short, male, female, etc..)
	- coffee tables (glass, plastic, wood, etc..)
	- bait (cheese, apple, crackers, etc)
- Whether something has a mind has nothing to do with its particular physical composition, but only with the functions (jobs, tasks) it performs
- When we talk about our mental states, we are actually talking about our brain states, but in vocabulary that describes their functional roles
- Physically different kinds of things that can think, feel, etc., so long as they do what our brains do when we think, feel, etc... (same functions = same mental stats)

## Functionalism & Artificial Intelligence
If a machine could be built that does the same jobs, performs the same tasks, etc.m that our brains do when we think, feel, etc., then that machine also thinks, feels, etc

## Artificial Intelligence
Weak Artificial Intelligence: A machine that does the same jobs that we do when we think only simulates intelligence

## Could a machine think
- Machine: an artifact manufactured from inorganic materials
- Think: whatever it is that we do when we think
Question: How would we tell if we successfully built a supercomputer that can think

## Alan Turing (1912-1954)
- "The original question, 'Can machines think?' I believe this to be too meaningless to deserve discussion"
- replaced this question with another

## The "Imitation Game" (Turing Test)

# Tutorial
## Mind-Brain identity
Mental states=physical brain states
Ex "Pain" = C-fibre excitations in the nervous system
Objection 1 = Chauvinistic, we are 'special'
Objection 2= Multiple Realizability of mental states

## Two types of AI
Weak AI - Limited functioning (Calculator/Roomba)
Strong AI - Replicates thought processes
