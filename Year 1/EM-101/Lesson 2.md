# Movie

## How is the fictional teacher in the film introduced?
She is introduced when we see her coming out of her house and riding her bike to school. We see her come into the school, say hello to some of her students and then see her start teaching her class.

## What does the teacher look like? What are his/her qualities and characteristics?
The teacher has short blonde hair and she dresses more colourfully than her other colleagues and the students in the school. She is very caring and has a lot of confidence and hope for her students in the future

## How do students respond to this teacher?
The students like their teacher and respond well to her teaching style. In one of the first scenes, she tells a story about a man she met, (who might have been her husband), one of the students starts crying because the story is sad and it shows that she cares about what the teacher is saying. A few of her students also like her enough to go eat lunch with her outside instead of in the cafeteria with all the other students. 

When Ms.brodie told the girls to think of someone dedicated, one of the girls asks of they can think of her. 

## What kind of relationship does this teacher have with his/her colleagues, administration, parents and larger community?
She was caught kissing one of the male teachers. She also seems to be in a relationship with another one of the teachers. Her relationship with the principal is not very good because the principal is pushing a more conservative style of teaching and Ms.Brody is less conservative and is trying to change things.

## Is this teacher satisfied with teaching? Why and why not?
I believe this teacher is satisfied with teaching because:
- Calls her students "Brody Girls"
- When she was told to resign and was threatened to be fired, she said she is proud to be a teacher and threatened to sue the school if they couldn't find evidence to fire her
- When the principal questioned the girls loyalty to ms.brody she started crying because she wondered if the girls were loyal to her showing how much she cares about them

## What kinds of day-to-day duties does this teacher have?
They seem like typical teacher duties like teaching the class, going out for lunch and stuff.

## How does he/she go about teaching his/her subject?
