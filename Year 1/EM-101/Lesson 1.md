# The Teachers We Have Known

## 1. Quickly list the names of those teachers and beside those names make notes as to why they were your favourite teachers.

- Mr.Primaylon (Gr.8) - Funny, Cared about our interests, always made time in his day to help us
- Mr.Mellor (Gr.3) - Made challenges throughout the year for our groups to keep us motivated, would stay in with lunch and play games with us, engaged us in his lessons in creative ways.
- Mr.Hill (Gr.12) - Would always help with any problems you had even if they were not related to school, always willing to stay after class or during lunch to help you, would stay at school late to run clubs.
-  Mrs.Neshi  & Mr.Conway (Gr.9-12 alternating) - Enthusiastic teaching styles that are engaging, would reach out to you if they saw you weren't doing well, always willing to talk about anything, wanted you to succeed.

## 2. Now, list the teachers you can think of that appeared in any films, television shows, books, cartoons etc…that you have read. Again, beside their names make any notes that come to mind.

- Miss Honey (Matilda) - Kind, cared about the kids education, wanted her class to succeed, all her students loved her.

# The "Ideal" Teacher

## Take a moment and think about the “ideal” teacher. What does this teacher do? Now, take about five minutes and describe in writing this teacher.

	The ideal teacher to me is someone who is willing to take the time out of their day to help their students succeed. They also only teach their students, and instead they also run clubs and teams. The Ideal teacher is also someone who can be like a friend to the student and talk to them about more than just school, and know them on a more personal level. It is also someone who enjoys teaching and is excieted to do it and make learning an enjoyable experience.

I think these are realistic descriptions but I think a teacher like this is rare because I think doing all these things everyday would get exhausting, But I have had some teachers like this in the past.

## The Celluloid Teacher

### Main Topic

Tried to create a composite image of what populat culture suggests is an effective teacher by describing what the problems with today's schools and students really are an what needs to be done to fix those problems.

### Issue

### Position

### Quality

### Topic: How do these stereotypes both inspire and mislead the general public with regards to the day to day work of teachers?

- filmmakers have ignores the realities of teaching to create fairytale like stories of battles fought and won.
- The ideal teachers in movies don't have lives outside of teaching
- Last paragraph of page 7/312

## Images

1. The first image looks almost identical to all the classrooms I have been taught in with a few exceptions like my tech classes and labs. When I was in younger grades like 1-4, we sat in groups instead of individual desks.
2. The second image seems to be a lot more hands on learning. I think the teacher is the one on the left facing the camera. The teacher is watching the students tinker with something and he seems to be letting them figure things out on their own while observing from the side. This is similar to the tech classes I have been in where we sit in groups at larger tables and work independently or with another person without a lot of input from the teacher.

## Video
1. The kids would become the teachers and teach the other kids how to use the computers that were placed in the walls.
2. The students who took the test with access to the computers and got a 76% and when they took the test again without computers at a later date, they did the same or better
