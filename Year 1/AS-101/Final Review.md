# Lecture 5: Light and matter
## The nature of light
## Light as a wave and as a particle
## Wavelength & Frequency
## The Electromagnetic spectrum
## Photon energy
## Interactions of light with matter
## Properties of Thermal radiation
## Wavelength of maximum intensity
## Spectroscopy
## Temperature and heat
- Heat Refers to the amount of energy
- Temperature refers to the intensity of heat
### Absolute zero
## Blackbody radiation
## The Doppler effect
### Blueshift
### Redshift
## Radial velocity
## Telescopes
### The three powers of a telescope
- Light gathering power
- Resolving power
- Magnifying power
### Two kinds of telescopes
- Refracting telescope
- Reflecting telescope
### The best location for a telescope - Light pollution
### Interferometry
### Hubble Space Telescope - JWST

# Lecture 6: Characteristics of our solar system
## The Solar System
## The Edge-Center Problem
## Olbers' Paradox
## Observable universe - Cosmic Expansion
## The sizes of galaxy redshifts are proportional to galaxy distances (Hubble law)
## The Big Bang Theory
## Solar nebula theory
### Five steps to planet formation in solar nebula theory
Starts ~4.6 billion years ago
#### 1. Collapse-Cloud of stellar dust
#### 2. Spinning

## Characteristic properties of the solar system
- Disk-shaped of the solar system
- Orbits in nearly the same plane
- Common direction of rotation and revolution
## Two planetary types
### Terrestrial
- Inner planets;  High-density
 - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
 - Only Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere and liquid water on the surface
 - Earth and Mars rotate at about the same rate
 - Venus and mercury are much slower
 - venus rotates in the opposite direction
- Earth and Mars have moons, Mercury and Venus don't
- Earth and mercury have magnetic fields; Venus and Mars don't
### Jovian 
- Outer planets; Low density
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
- Planetary rings and large satellite systems
### Pluto is neither terrestrial or jovian

### Exoplanets are planets beyond the solar system. Discovered by the "wobble" rom their parent star
## Space debris - Asteroids comets, and meteoroids
 - Asteroids in the inner solar system, are composition of terrestrial planets
 - Comets in the outer solar system, a composition like jovian planets, are Icy and have a tail
 - Meteoroids enter earths atmosphere (or that of another planet like Mars) at high speeds and burn up, the fireballs or shooting stars are called meteors
 - Meteorite - when a meteoroid survives the trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground
 - Meteor showers happen when the earth passes through a comet tail

# Lecture 7: The stars
## Luminosity and Apparent Brightness
## Stellar temperatures
## The radiation from stars is blackbody radiation
### Blackbody: An object that absorbs all radiation falling on it, at all wavelengths emitted by an opaque object

## Red Giants
- Luminous giant stars of low or intermediate mass in a late phase of evolution, surface temperature low ~5000k
## White dwarfs
- Small stars, have a mass comparable to the sun, and volume comparable to the Earth so they are very dense. Comprise roughly 6% of all known stars
- The final evolutionary state of all stars
- The Chandrasekhar limit
	- 1.4 solar masses, is the theoretical maximum mass of a white dwarf before it collapses into a neutron star

## Fate of the sun
- Sun will shrink into a white dwarf
## Hertzspring-Russel (H-R) diagram
- Plot of luminosity vs. surface temperature
## Neutron stars
- Typical mass between 1.35 and 2.0 solar mass
## Black Hole
- Neutron stars when exceed 2.2 solar masses collapse into black holes
- A black hole is a region of spacetime from which nothing can escape, even light
- The curvature of spacetime becomes greater as we approach a black hole and a black hole itself is like a bottomless pit in spacetime
- Shwarzchild Radius and Event Horizon

1. General relativity Effects near black holes
	- From far, the gravitational fields of a black hole and a star of the mass are virtually identical
	- At small distances, the much deeper gravitational potential will become noticeable
2. General Relativity effects near Black holes
3. Tital effects-stretched vertically
4. General relativity effects near black holes
5. Time dilation
6. General relativity effects near Black Holes
	- Gravitational Redshift - all wavelengths of emissions are stretched (red-shifted)
### Observing Black Holes
- Can not be observed directly
- Infer the presence of black holes by detecting their effect on other matter nearby
## Dark matter and Dark energy
- Dark matter makes up most of the mass of galaxies and galaxy clusters and is responsible for the way galaxies are organized on grand scales
- Dark energy, si the name we give the mysterious influence driving the accelerated expansion of the universe
## Formation of stars llke the sun
### Stage 1
- Interstellar cloud starts to contract, probably triggered by shock or pressure wave from a nearby star
- As it contracts, the cloud fragments into smaller pieces
### Stage 2
- Individual cloud fragments begin to collapse
- Once the density is high enough, there is no further fragmentation
### Stage 3
- The interior of the fragment has begun heating as is about 10,000K
Planetary formation has begun, the the protostar is not in equilibrium. All heating comes from gravitational collapse
### Stage 6
- Core reaches 10 Million K and nuclear fusion begins
- The protostar has become a star
### Stage 7
- The star continues to contract and increase the temperature until it is in equilibrium
- The star has reached the *Main Sequence* and will remain there as long as it has hydrogen to fuse in its core
# Lecture 8: Comparative Planetology of the Terrestrial Planets
## Differentiated
- Crust - topmost low-density rocky layer
- Mantle - between the crust and core, composed of dense rock
- Core - High density, metallic composition
## Earth atmosphere
- First (primary atmosphere)
- Secondary atmosphere
- Greenhouse effect
- (Global warming)
## Factors of long term climate change
- Solar Brightening
- Changes in axis tilt
- Changes in Reflectivity
- Changes in Greenhouse Gases
