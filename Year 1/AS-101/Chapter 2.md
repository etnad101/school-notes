# The stars
## The names of stars
- Most [[Star | star]] names are derived from ancient Arabic
	- for example, Betelgeuse comes from the Arabic phrase "yad aljawaz" ("armpit of jawza")
- Many of the ancient names are still used
- The closest [[Star | star]] to the sun is Proxima Centauri

[[Star | Stars]] that appear close in the sky may not actually be close in space. Brighter [[Star | stars]] will appear closer, and closer [[Star | stars]] will appear brighter.

Method of locating - specify their constellation and rank the stars on their brightness

## The Brightness of Stars
- The magnitude scale 
	- astronomical brightness scale
- Hipparchus 
	- The first to catalogue [[Star | stars]] by their brightness
- Ptolemy used the magnitude system
	- The larger the magnitude, the fainter the [[Star | star]]
- Flux
	- A measure of the flow of energy out of a surface
- Apparent visual magnitude (mv)
	- A measure of the brightness of a [[Star | star]] as seen by human eyes on earth

The full moon has a magnitude of -12.6 while the magnitude of the sun is about -26.7.
The moon is +14.1 magnitudes fainter

## The Celestial Sphere
An imaginary sphere of a very large radius surrounding Earth, to which the celestial objects seem to be attached.

- Stars *seem* to be on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding the Earth which is assumed to be fixed
- Planet Earth - fixed at the hub of the celestial sphere
- Simplest possible models of the universe
	- But doesn't agree with the facts we now know about the cosmos

The point where you look straight up is the zenith, and the opposite point is the nadir

At the north pole, the stars circle the zenith and do not rise and set
At the equator, the celestial poles are on the horizon, and the stars rise straight up and straight down


<ins>3 important points</ins>
1. The westward motion of the sky is the consequence of the eastward rotation of the earth
2. The appearance of the sky depends on the observer's location on Earth
3. The astronomical "distances are measured in degrees"

## What are Latitude and Longitude
- parameters or coordinates that help determine the location of any place on earth
- Both latitude and longitude are angles that uniquely define points on the Earth's sphere
- They form a system or scheme to locate or identify geographic positions on the Earth's surface
- Latitudes are parallel horizontal lines that measure distance north or south of the equator
- Longitudes are non-parallel vertical lines that go east and west
- Every 10 degrees on the longitude is a 30-minute time zone difference

## Celestial coordinates
Declination (dec)
- (analog of latitude)
- measured in degrees north or south of the celestial equator

Right ascension (RA)
- (analog of longitude)
- measured in hours, minutes, and seconds eastward from the position of the Sun at the vernal equinox(it can be arbitrary)

## Angular size and Angular distance
Since we cannot accurately judge how far objects in the sky are we cannot tell their true size
we can talk about the angular size and angular distance between two objects
angular size or distance is measured in degrees

### Angular Units
- The angular size of your finger at arm's length is about 1º.
- An object's angular size appears smaller if it is further away. This relationship is useful for calculating actual distances or sizes.

- The moon and the sun have nearly the same angular size, about 0.5º

## The Motions of Celestial Bodies
- Rotation - Motion around an axis passing through a rotating body (Rotation of earth/Day and night)
- Revolution - Orbital motion about a point located outside the orbiting body (Revolution of the earth around the sun/years)

- Precession is the slow change in the orientation of Earth’s axis of rotation.  
- The precession cycle is about 26,000 years

## Seasons
- The seasons are caused by the changes in the amount of solar energy that Earth's northern and southern hemispheres receive at different times in the year
- This is because of the tilt of the earth
- The earth is closer to the sun in winter and further in the summer

4 special points:
- Summer solstice: June 21
- Winter solstice: December 21
- Spring (vernal) equinox: March 21
- Fall (autumnal) equinox: September 22


# Phases of the Moon

## Earth's orbital motion

![[Solar Day]]

![[Sidereal Day]]

All of the planets orbit the sun in the same plane along with the earth

The normal kind of 24h day is the *Solar* day

The length of a "star" day is called a *Sidereal* day

the solar day is 4 minutes longer than the sidereal day
- Daily cycle, noon-noon (or one sunrise to the next) is diurnal motion - solar day
- Stars are not in the same place 24 hours later due to the earth's rotation around the sun. When they are, 1 sidereal day has passed

Tropical (solar) year - Time between successive spring (or autumnal) equinoxes
Sidereal year - The time for the earth to complete one full orbit around the sun relative to any other star.

The tropical (solar) year is about 11 minutes shorter than the sidereal year

## The phases of the moon
### The moon
- The moon produces no visible light of its own
- it shines only reflected light
- Half of the moon is always bright
- the other half is always dark

### Motion of the moon
- The moon rotates on its axis with exactly the same period at which it revolves about the earth, thus it keeps the same face turned toward the earth
- The near side is the hemisphere facing the earth
- The far side is the hemisphere facing away from the earth

relative position of the sun, earth, and moon are what cause the phases of the moon

it takes about 29.5 (Lunar synodic month) days to go through the whole cycle of phases, i.e. the time between successive New moons
phases are due to different amounts of the sunlit portion being visible from the earth

- the moon orbits the earth every 27.32 days (Lunar sidereal period)
- Its orbit around the earth is elliptical
- The moon's rotation period is equal to its orbital period

The moon's apparent rising east and setting west is from the rotation of the earth, NOT the moon's orbit around Earth.

The lunar orbit is slower and harder to see

Waxing = increasing
Waning = decreasing
Crescent = Crescent shape
Gibbous = inverse Crescent

New moon -> Waxing Crescent -> First Quarter -> Waxing Gibbous -> V
^ <- Waning Crescent <- Third Quarter <- Waning Gibbous <-  Full moon 

| Phase         | Rise        | Set         |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| New Moon      | 6 AM        | 6 PM        |
| First Quarter | 12 Noon     | 12 Midnight |
| Full Moon     | 6 PM        | 6 AM        |
| Third Quarter | 12 Midnight | 12 Noon     |

| Tropical (solar) year 365.25 days - 11 minutes | Sidereal year 365.25 days |                           |

## Eclipses
### Solar
- Sun, moon, and earth are in a straight line
- Four types of solar eclipses
	- total
	- partial
	- hybrid
	- annular
- depends on how the moon aligns with the earth and the sun, and how far away the moon is from the earth

The corona is the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere. It is usually hidden by the bright light of the sun's surface but can be seen during a solar eclipse


### Lunar
 ![[Umbra]]
 ![[Penumbra]]
 -Lunar eclipse is only at full moon
 - Sun, earth, and moon are in a straight line
- Three types of lunar eclipses
	- total
		- when the entire moon is temporarily darkened as it passes through the [[Umbra]]
		- The moon darkens and turns copper-red because only red light is able to pass completely through the earth's atmosphere
	- partial
		- when only a portion of the moon's surface is affected as only part of it passes through the [[Umbra]]
	- penumbral
		- The moon passes through the earth's faint [[Penumbra | penumbral]] shadow
