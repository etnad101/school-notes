# The Origin of Modern Astronomy
Indigenous gave the name for Polaris

## Ancient Astronomy
- Palaeolithic cave paintings in France (15 000 BCE) may represent a star map or the zodiac
- Egyptians were responsible for the emergence of a 365-day calendar (Around 2500 BCE)
- Stonehenge may have served as an observatory
- Babylonians were some of the most meticulous record keepers
- The earliest known record of a supernova explosion in 1400 BCE was recorded by China
- Recorded solar and lunar eclipses from 5th century BCE
- Ancestral Pueboloans (New Mexico USA) may have recorded supernova

### Astronomy from 900 BCE to 0 CE
- The Greeks were among the first to develop models to explain what they observed in the universe
- Thales of Miletus - correctly predicted a solar eclipse
- Pythagoras - suggested that the earth is a sphere and not flat
- Eratosthenes - calculated Earth's circumference 

## Astronomy from 0 CE to 1500 CE
- Knowledge of astronomy expanded with the contributions from Greece, the Middle East and India
- Alexander the Great - founded the city of Alexandria in Egypt
- Hypatia - a female astronomer and mathematician, was the director of the observatory in Alexandria
- Aryabhata - The Indian astronomer and mathematician

### The geocentric model of the Universe
 - Aristotle was known throughout the Middle Ages as "The Philosopher"
 - He believed as a first principle that the heavens were perfect
 - All motion in the perfect heavens must be caused by the rotation of spheres carrying objects around in uniform circular motion.

### Claudius Ptolemy
- Ptolemy gave mathematical form to Aristotle's model in about 140 CE
- He kept the [[geocentric]] principle, but he added off-center circles and variable speeds to better predict the motion of the planets
- All motion in the perfect heavens must be caused by the rotation of spheres carrying objects around in uniform circular motion

Retrograde motion is when the planet was thought to go backwards then go back and catch up with orbit.
Retrograde motion was difficult to explain so Ptolemy introduced epicycles.
The deferent is the path that the planet should take
The apparent retrograde motion is actually caused because the earth is not in the center

	• Ptolemaic model- the Earth is flat and immobile  
	• All of the celestial bodies (the Sun, Moon, planets, stars) move around the  
	Earth.  
	• Based on the idea that the heavens should be built on geometrical ideals.  
	• The celestial sphere was thought of as an actual, very real, crystalline  
	sphere.  
	• The stars were thought to be fixed onto this outer perfect sphere.  
	• Inside this sphere were other perfect spheres on which were attached the 7  
	"planets" in the following order (outer to inner)--Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun,  
	Venus, Mercury, Moon.  
	• Each of these perfect spheres turned at its own rate and anything  
	attached to them would have motions that are perfect circles.  
	• However, Ptolemy was quite aware of the retrograde motion problem--the  
	planets appear at times to move backwards in the sky.  
	
	 Since all motions had to be in perfect circles, Ptolemy (and earlier scholars) embellished the model by adding epicycles, and little circles on circles. He also offset the circles so that they were not centred on Earth. With these enhancements, the model could predict the future positions of the planets within a degree or so, which was pretty good at the time.  

### The Heliocentric Model
- Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 - 1543) proposed the heliocentric model of the universe
- Copernicus' book "De Devolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was published after his death

The retrograde motion was finally explained in a straightforward manner
There was no need for epicycles
The apparent retrograde motion was caused by the motion of the earth from which one observes

	• There is no one centre in the universe.  
	• The Earth's centre is not the centre of the universe.  
	• The centre of the universe is near the sun.  
	• The distance from the Earth to the sun is imperceptible  
	compared with the distance to the stars.  
	• The rotation of the Earth accounts for the apparent daily  
	rotation of the stars.  
	• The apparent annual cycle of movements of the sun is caused  
	by the Earth revolving around it.  
	• The apparent retrograde motion of the planets is caused by  
	the motion of the Earth from which one observes  

### Tycho Brahe
- Danish nobleman and astronomer
- Built and Built an impressive observatory and spent 20 years measuring the positions of the stars and planets.  
- Hired Johannes Kepler.  

### Johannes Kepler
- Despite being of poor health, Kepler excelled in school and won entrance to the university at Tubingen
- Studied motions of planets and discovered how planets move

#### Kepler's 3 Laws
![[Ellipse]]
![[Eccentricity]]

1. Planets travel on elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus
2. Planetary orbits sweep out equal areas in equal time (i.e. planets move faster when they are close to the sun and slower when they are further)
3. The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit
	- $p^{2}=a^{3}$
	- p = orbital period in years
	- a = avg distance from sun in [[Astronomical Unit | AU]]

### Galileo Galilei
- Born in 1564
- Studies medicine and later became a professor of mathematics
- Built working telescopes in his workshop and embarked on carefully observing the night sky
- Did *NOT* invent the telescope but was the first to carefully observe the night sky with it

#### The Starry Messenger
Galileo published a book called "The Starry Messenger" that reported 2 major discoveries:
1. The moon is not perfect (There are mountains and valleys)
2. There are four moons orbiting Jupiter (They are now known as the Galilean moons)

### Issac Newton
- Born in 1642
- Uses the work of Kepler and Galileo to discover the 3 laws of motion

#### Motion
- Speed is the rate at which an object moves
- Velocity specifies both speed and direction of travel of an object
- acceleration is the rate of change of velocity

#### Newtons 3 Laws of Motion
- An object continues at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by some force
- An object's change in motion is proportional to the force acting on it, and is in the direction of the force
- When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an equal and opposite force back on the first body

#### Universal theory of gravitation
$$F1=F2=G\frac{(M\times{m})}{r^{2}}$$
$$G=6.6743\times {10^{-11}}$$

#### Weight vs. Mass
- Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in the object
- Weight is the force that gravity exerts on an object
