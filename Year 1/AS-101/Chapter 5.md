- The universe has no edge or center
- The universe is 13.6 billion years old

![[Cosmology]]

## The necessity of a beginning
- Olber's paradox = the conflict between theory and evidence regarding the darkness of the night sky
- Observable universe = The part of the universe you can see from your location in space and time. The limits of the observable universe are due to its age

## Cosmic Expansion
### Hubble
- in 1929, Edwin Hubble published his discovery that the sizes of galaxy redshifts are proportional to galaxy distances (Hubble Law)
- suggests that the observable universe is expanding
- The universe is thought to have originated from a singularity
	- This theory came from observing the redshift of galaxies
	- Known as the Big Bang Theory
	- This is the currently accepted model

### Why is our view of the universe limited?
limits to what we can observe are set by 3 things:
1. The rate of expansion
2. The time since the Big Bang (age)
3. The speed of light

## The History of the atoms in your body
- The matter in our solar system formed during the Big Bang
- Atoms heavier than helium formed in successive generations of stars
- Our solar system may exist because of a supernova explosion that occurred about 4.6 billion years ago

## The origin of the solar system
- Solar nebula theory - A theory of the formation of the solar system consistent without current observations that describes how a rotating cloud of gas and dust gravitationally collapsed and flattened into a disk around the sun forming at the center and the planets forming around it.
- Earth and the other planets of our solar system formed billions of years ago as teh sun condensed from the interstellar medium.

Condensation theory - interstellar dust grains help cool clouds, and act as condensation nuclei

- A cloud of dust formed in a nebula
- Sometime the cloud of dust collapsed
- When it collapsed, it fell in on itself creating a disk of material surrounding it
- Gravity pulls dust together
- as it gets pulled together, the rotation speeds up (conservation of angular momentum)
- Temperature and pressure rise continually to ~(1 000 000ยบC) resulting in nuclear fusion creating the sun
- The sun used more than 99% of the stuff in the disk
- The material left over clumped up because of gravity. Eventually, they got big enough to form planets and dwarf planets
- The accumulation through gravity is called accretion
- A particle grows by condensation when it adds matter one atom at a time from surrounding gas
## An inventory of the solar system
- we used to only know the moon, stars, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, comets, and meteors
- we now know the solar system has 135 moons, one star, nine planets, asteroids, comets and meteoroids

The distance from the sun is known from Kepler's laws
An orbital period can be observed
radius is known from the angular size
masses are from newtons laws
rotation period from observations
density is calculated knowing the radius and mass

All orbits except Pluto and Mercury are close to the same plane

- Every planet in the solar system rotate counter-clockwise, except for venus and uranus

### Terrestrial planets
- Earth-like planets made up of rocks or metals with a hard surface
- have a molten heavy-metal core, few moods and topological features such as valleys, volcanoes and craters
- no rings
- weak magnetic fields
### Jovian planets
- Very large plants comprised of gas, rather than solid rock
- refer to a group of four planets in the solar system also known as gas giants
- gigantic compared to Earth, and have a gaseous nature like Jupiter
- Have rings
- strong magnetic fields

### Pluto
- Neither terrestrial nor jovian
- Relatively small terrestrial body
- Charon is the largest of Pluto's five moons
#remember
- Pluto-Charon is our solar system's only known double planetary system
- the same surfaces of Charon and Pluto always face each other, a phenomenon called mutual tidal locking

## Interplanetary matter
- The inner solar system, - is the vast space among nine known planets there are small chunks of matter

- Asteroids and meteoroids are fragments of rocky material, similar in composition to the outer layer of terrestrial planets
- Asteroids are 100m in diameter and meteoroids are less than 100m in diameter
- Comets are predominantly icy rather than rocky in composition and their typical diameter is a 1-10km range

- Meteoroids are objects in space that range in size from grains of dust to small asteroids, "space rocks"
- When they enter Earth's atmosphere, or another planet, at high speeds and burn up, the fireballs are called meteors
- when a meteor survives the trip and hits the ground it is called a meteorite

### The asteroid belt
- between Mars and Jupiter
- majority of asteroids are in this belt
#### Earth-crossing asteroids
- orbit intersects that of the earth
#### Trojan asteroids
- share an orbit with Jupiter
- remaining a constant 60ยบ ahead or behind that of Jupiter
- Gravitationally trapped in Jupiter's orbit around the sun for billions of years
- Hold clues to the formation of our solar system

## What killed the dinosaurs?
- May have been killed by the impact of a large meteor or a small asteroid

## Comets
- Will always have a tail
- The tail is always in the opposite direction of the sun because of solar winds
- Comets will orbit the sun and come back
- The size, shape, and orientation of cometary orbits depend on their location. Oort cloud
- comets rarely enter the inner solar system

- Meteor showers are associated with comets, they are the debris left over when a comet breaks up
- If Earth passed through the tail of a comet, A meteor shower would occur

## Planets beyond the solar system
- Many planets have been discovered in other solar system
- Some planets are discoverable through the "wobble" they create in their parent star's orbit
- Others are discovered by the dimming of their parent star's luminosity
