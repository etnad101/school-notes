This model is not perfect

## The Galactic Nucleus
- use radio waves to see the center of milky way
- Center is likely a massive black hole with a mass of 3 - 4 million solar masses

## Types of galaxies
- Spiral
	- Like our milky way
	- Mainly flat white disks with yellowish bulges at the center
	- Cotain stars of all ages
	- display spiral arms
- Elliptical galaxies
	- Redder in colour
	- contain older stars
	- rounded in shape (like a football)
- irregular
	- All other shapes that are neither spiral or elliptical

### Spiral
![[Barred spiral galaxies]]
-  The milk way is probably a barred galaxy
![[Lenticular galaxies]] 

### Elliptical
- Usually found in clusters
- less than 20% of all elliptical galaxies are found outside clusters
![[Dwarf Elliptical Galaxies]]

### Irregular galaxies
- More distant galaxies in the universe are irregulars
- the earliest galaxies (at the edge of the universe) are more commonly irregular

## Measuring Cosmic Distances
### Standard Candles
- We must have some standard luminosity with which to compare all other stars
- This is known as **_Standard Candle_**
- E.g. We know the luminosity of our sun (G2 star) so we can compare the two luminosities and use the luminosity-distance formula to calculate the distance

### Within our solar system
- Uses 'radar-ranging'
- Bouncing radio waves or light waves off planets and measuring the time it takes the wave to travel the distance and back to earth

### Within our galaxy to nearby stars
- Measured using parallax

### Within our Galaxy
- Comparing luminosity to our sun isn't useful much beyond 1000ly
- Instead, we must find brighter standard candles
1. Find star clusters where we can measure their distance by parallax
2. plot the H-R diagram for the stars in the cluster
3. use the luminosity-distance relationship to determine the luminosities of the main sequence stars
4. look at clusters farther away usin the new luminosity standard candles just worked out and determine their distances using the luminosity-distance formula
This is known as **Main Sequence Fitting**

### Nearby Galaxies
- Same method as within our galaxy, but with even brighter stars
- Use [[Cepheids]]

### Edge of the Universe
- Using the brightest object in each galaxy as the standard candle
- measure the amount that the light was "redshifted"
- The amount of the Doppler shift is how fast a galaxy is moving away from us

## Age of the universe
- Current estimates say between 12-16 billion years
- a very recent estimate says 13.8 billion years

## Galactic sizes and masses
- Irregular galaxies tend to be smaller than the Milky Way
	- some as small as 1% of the Milky Way size
	- also have low luminosity
- Masses of galaxies are determined with the rotation curve method

smaller galaxies are as little as one millionth the mass of the Milky Way while the largest contain 50 or more times that of our galaxy

# Lesson 9: Galactic Evolution
## The really big picture
- Higher mass systems are more organized than systems with lower mass
- Spiral galaxies get more organized over time
	- They also spin faster, and have more energy

## Starburst Galaxies
- Form new stars at rates of over 100 per year (milky way produces about 5 per year)
- Use up all the interstellar gas in about 200 million years (relatively short)
- Emit most radiation in infrared spectrum therefore not visible from the surface of earth
- produces supernovae 100x faster than milky way
	- supernovae combine to form an expanding bubble of gas that breaks out into space beyond the galaxy, creatin a galaxtin wind

## Really Active Galaxies
- AGNs (Active galactic nuclei) are galaxies where much of the energy streaming away appears to be coming from the galactic nucleus/core
- One type of AGN is known as a Seyfert galaxy
	- The gasses at the centre move away from their centres over 30x faster than normal spiral galaxies
	- Most Seyfert galaxies occur in pairs
	- cores of sexperts contain supermassive black holes
