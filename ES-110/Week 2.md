Read Chapter 7

## Bison population decline
- There were an estimated 60-100 million plains bison in North America at the time of European contact
- By the late 1800s only a few hundred plains bison remained in the wild
- Wood bison populations likely declined from 150,000+ animals to a few hundred by 1900

### Settlers' Bison Hunting
Settlers hunted bison for:
- For skins
- To open grazing land for cattle
- To hasten the removal of Indigenous people from the plains

### Limiting factors for bison population before European contact
- Human predation
- non-human predation
- climate, weather
- disease
- availability of grass
- natural hazards(e.g. floods, fires)

### Limiting factors for bison population after European contact
- European predation
- [[Anthropogenic]] habitat change (fences, cattle, plowing)
- climate, weather
- disease

### Canadian conservation efforts to save the Plains bison
- by 1888 there were only 8 plains bison left in Canada
- in 1907, the Canadian government bought 400 bison from Montana ranchers and released them at Elk Island National Park
- Western Canadian bison herds became infected with cattle diseases, further complicating recovery efforts
- Today there are ~2000 wild plains bison in Canada

## What is Biodiversity
- Term is short for “biological diversity”  
- Scientists have shown evidence that biological diversity is declining in many parts of the world 25

### Scale of the biodiversity crisis
- One-third of all known land vertebrate species are declining in numbers
![[Background Extinction]]

## Key causes of biodiversity decline & species extinction:
- Destruction or damage to habitat caused by humans
- Pollution
- Overexploitation
- Invasive species
- Climate change

## How do we define biodiversity
Boreal forest:
- small # of tree species
- large # of each species/unit area
- Lowe Richness

Tropical Rainforest:
- large # of tree species,  
- smaller # of each species/unit area  
- higher richness Species richness (the number of species in a given habitat)  

- Species evenness (the relative abundance of species in a given habitat)

## Genetic Diversity
- Generally, species are healthier and have better long-term chances of survival if there is high genetic diversity among individuals  
- E.g. Most wild Plains bison in Canada are descended from 400 individual animals that were imported in 1907 from a single herd in the US  
-  They have become plagued by diseases carried by cattle

## Genes

## Why is genetic diversity good
- It makes the species more adaptable to a changing environment
- All Individual organisms within the same species typically have the same number, similar types of genes
- However, not all individuals within a species are identically alike genetically; there are slight variations

## Alleles
- A given gene may have 2 or more molecular structures; these variants are known as alleles  
- With every generation of offspring, the alleles get shuffled into new combinations (except in the case of identical twins)  
- Sometimes this shuffling results in genetic outcomes that are detrimental to the organism, sometimes beneficial – especially when a random mutation gets mixed in

## Genetic basis for biological adaptation
- Assume that a gene mutates  
- If the mutation turns out to be beneficial to the individual...  
- The individual may have more offspring than other members of the population  
- If the mutation is passed onto the offspring, then they will have more offspring than their competitors  
- Etc, etc

## Classic example: camouflage

## Genetic basis for behavioural adaptation
- Imagine a species of bird that nests in oak trees  
- A few individuals carry an allele (B) which prompts them to nest in pine trees  
- Imagine the local climate becomes much colder, and oak trees start to die off, and are replaced by conifers, including pines  
- The birds with allele B now have more nesting options than the other birds of the same species  
- Over time, this bird species will shift from being predominantly oak-nesting birds to predominantly pine-nesting birds  

## Ecological Diversity
- Refers to the variety of different types of ecosystems found in a given area or region
- Human activity can reduce ecological diversity, such as by converting forests to grazing land or converting native grassland to farmland

## Functional and structural diversity
- These terms refer to the physical characteristics of a given ecosystem or area and whether it is operating normally/well

## Structural Diversity
![[Ecological niche]]

## Habitats nested within habitats
![[Habitat]]

## Keystone species
- A species that when missing, causes significant changes to [[Habitat | habitats]], ecosystems
- When the keystone species is removed, other species may wither grow or fall in numbers

## Why is biodiversity important
Employment, livelihoods
- The jobs, incomes and livelihoods of many people depend upon a healthy, biodiverse environment

Valuable Resources
- Chestnut trees once filled North American forests, providing food for people, food for animals people hunted, and high-quality wood

Food systems
- Native pollinator species are in decline  
- Why does this matter?  
- One-third of all food crops require insect pollination Native bumblebee at work.

# Lecture 4: Preventing biodiversity loss

## Species numbers are always changing
- Population fluctuates with environmental changes
- changes may be drastic under extreme conditions

## Carrying capacity
- Describes the upper limit to the number of organisms that an ecosystem can suport over the long term

## Environmental resistance
- The sum total of factors that limit hte potential for a species to increase its numbers or ite geographic range
- can be abiotic (temperature, availability of nutrients, amount of oxygen in water) or biotic factors (disease, parasites, predators)

## Biotic potential
- This refers to the capacity for a given species to increase its numbers under optimum conditions
- r (intrinsic rate of increase) is theoretically the fastest rate of increase for a species
- r rate does not actually happen in nature

## Classifying wildlife species by their reproductive potential
- Species that can reproduce quickly, with large numbers of offspring are called r-selected species  
- Species that reproduce slowly, with small numbers of offspring are called k-selected species

r-selected species = opportunists
Characteristics:
- reproduce at an early age
- have many offspring but give them little or no care
- population numbers fluctuate quickly
- describes many pests/nuisance species(cockroaches, rats)

k-selected species are the opposite
Characteristics:
- Reproduce later in life
- Have few offspring
- Are often attentive species
- Population numbers grow very slowly

- K-selected species typically have trouble competing with humans
- R-selected species thrive among humans

## Predation
![[Predation]]

## Critical Number
- The minimum number of organisms required to ensure that a population may reproduce and continue
- Without human intervention, a species that falls below this number will go extinct

## Population Growth
- The human population has doubled since 1975
- will likely add another 1-2 billion people by 2050

## Addressing The causes of biodiversity loss
Key causes of biodiversity loss are:  
- Destruction or damage to habitat caused by humans (Focus on this today)
- Pollution  
- Overexploitation  
- Invasive species  
- Climate change  

## Options
Protect habitat and/or protect species:  
- With laws and regulations  
- By creating protected areas  
- Through education and collective action  
- Through active interventions  

## Migratory Birds Conservation Act
- in 1916 Canada and the US signed a convention to protect migratory birds
- In the midst of WWI and within 24 months of the death of the last passenger pigeon
- Many birds are protected by MBCA, including robins, ducks, geese, swans, loons
- Birds that don't migrate are not protected

## CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of  Wild Fauna and Flora)
- International agreement to try and protect endangered species by limiting trade exports
- most countries have signed
-  provides varying levels of protection to 5,000 animal species and 29,000 plant species
- Lists ~1,200 near-extinct species illegal to trade (e.g. pandas, tigers)
- the problem is enforcement

## Canada's Species at Risk Act, 2003
- Purpose: to prevent endangered or threatened wildlife from becoming extinct or being lost from the wild, and to help in the  recovery of these species
- the federal cabinet decides what is on the list

## Common characteristics of SARA species
- Small, isolated sub-species of organisms more common to the US;
- species with large territorial requirements
- endemic to areas with heavy human use
- formerly targeted by humans for hunting

## Implications of SARA listing
- If an aquatic or migratory bird species, you cannot harm any individual or destroy its residence anywhere in Canada
- if any other type of organism, the prohibition applies only to federally owned public lands

## Canadian law division of responsibilities
- Natural resources are a provincial responsibility
- Navigable waterways are a federal responsibility
- The federal government has the responsibility for negotiating international agreements
- Hunting and fishing regulations are set by the provincial government

## Parks and protected areas
- Parks = areas set aside for a variety of reasons, one of which may be the conservation or protection of species or habitats
- some parks are heavily used for recreation, which may clash with the aims of wildlife protection
- Protected areas = areas set aside to minimize human disturbance

## Citizen interventions
- when concerned individuals and groups mobilize to protect species or habitats
- can force governments to take action
- challenges = mobilizing funds, keeping long-term momentum

## Habitat recreation
- try to undo pat damage or make human land use more compatible with biodiversity
- can be initiated by governments and private landowners

## Avoiding vehicle-wildlife conflicts
- During breeding season, amphibians, and reptiles often try crossing roadways

## Pollinator deserts
- Flowerless landscapes support no pollinators
- the traditional campus of mown green lawns supports no pollinators
- More flowers and clovers will help
