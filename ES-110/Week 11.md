# Lecture 1: Economic & political dimensions of sustainability
## Income equity in Canada
- 10% of Canadian adults own 35% of Canada's total wealth
- The bottom 50% of Canadian adults (as measured by wealth) on less than 10% of Canada's total wealth

## Wealth distribution in Canada
- 20% of Canadian households have a net worth of > $1 million

## How is household net worth calculated?
- Sum of asset: savings + investments + pension + life insurance
- Sum of liabilities
- Deduct liabilities from assets

## Canadian housing prices
- Housing prices skyrocketed during the pandemic and have fallen somewhat since 2022
- Interest rates have risen
- Nearly half of all household wealth in Canada is real estate
- Many people cannot afford to buy a home
- Many of those who bought a home during the pandemic are making higher mortgage payments for a home that's losing value

## Costs of finding a place to live
- To qualify for a mortgage in Toronto you need an annual income of $240,000 plus a down payment of $260,000
- Average price of a single-family home in Waterloo Nov 2023 = $890,000; in Toronto $1.3M
- The average cost to newly rent a 1 bedroom apt in Toronto in Nov 2023 = $2,600/month
- average 1 bedroom rend in Waterloo = $2000/month

## Economics 101 (sort of)
### Cost-benefit analysis of opening a pizza shop

| Costs                                                                            |     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Fixed costs: premises, equipment, financing                                      |     |
| Operating costs: employee wages, ingredients, pizza boxes, advertising, delivery |     |


### Valuing nature as a set of resources
- How much $ would the trees be worth as building material?
- Could we replace the forest with farmland?
- Could we build a ski resort on the mountain?
- Could we dam the river and sell hydroelectric power?
- Is there any gold or other valuable minerals in the river sediments?

### Applying a classical economics cost/benefit analysis to whales
- In 2008, there were 1.16M whale whale-watching visits in Canada
- In Quebec, the average whale watcher spent $142 per visit
- estimated $80M ($110M adjusted for inflation)

### Ecological economies
- A relatively new field emerged in the 1980s
- uses many of the same mathematical tools as traditional economics BUT

### Ecological goods and services
- A term used to describe the economic and cultural benefits provided to humans by ecosystems
Example: insect pllinaiton
- Many common food items require insect pollination
- We don't pay the insects anything
- But if we fail to protect them, we lose these crops
- In economics language: an externality

### Externalities
- Positive Externality = insects pollinate our food for free, everyone benefits
- Negative Externality = Automobile drivers pollute the air, everyone shares teh cost of air pollution

Make consumers/producers pay the full price of pollution
End subsidies for oil companies
Better labelling so that consumers can make knowledgeable choices
Ask governments to pass laws and regulations


## In Canada, who makes the laws & regulations with respect to the environment?
- It depends
- The Constitution Act allocated lawmaking responsibilities to federal and provincial governments
- Each level of government has its own responsibilities but they sometimes overlap

## Provinces delegate many responsibilities to cities and local governments
- Land use planning, housing developments, 

## Example: Taking action on climate change
- The federal government is responsible for making & acting upon international commitments to combat climate change
- Has legal power to impose taxes on Canadians, including a carbon tax
