Multiple choice week 9 - end
Written answers - entire course
## Humans as an urban species
- At the beginning of the 20th century, most people lived in rural areas
- In some countries, this is still the case (Africa, Asia)
- Today majority of humans live in Urban areas

## Demographic factors
- Urban growth = rural to urban migration + natural increase
- Rapid urbanization began in Europe, followed by North and South America
- Urbanization is accelerating in less developed countries

## Economic reasons to live in cities
- There is a wide diversity of economic opportunities
- In rural areas, wealth and opportunity are often tied closely to land tenure and control
- Access to education, health and other social services is usually better in cities
- Governments allocate more financial resources to urban populations

## Urbanization trends
- Happening very rapidly in less-developed regions
- Many of these cities do not have the infrastructure in place to support rapid growth
- This leaves large numbers of people trapped in impoverished, ecologically degraded urban & suburban environments

## Urban environmental challenges
- Differ between developed and less developed regions
- In Canada, US, Europe, they revolve around issues like sprawl, infrastructure maintenance, public transportation, and increasing housing
- In poorer nations, they revolve around basic needs like shelter, water supply, sanitation, managing wastes

## Political environmental benefits of cities
- The benefits of scale: easier and more cost-effective to provide transportation, municipal water and sewage, and meet other needs when people are concentrated in one place
- On a per capita basis, people living in NYC consume less energy, and produce fewer GHG emissions than people living in rural New York state

## Environmental realities of cities
- Urban centers are not self-sustaining
- Their food, and water supplies must be obtained elsewhere
- Wastes are typically disposed of elsewhere
- Urban waterways are easily degraded
- Air quality is often poor
- As they expand outwards they pave over agricultural land
- Cities become 'heat islands'
- Buildings and large areas of impermeable surfaces trap solar radiation

## Urban centres are concentrated point sources of pollution
- Concentration of people in one spot means concentration of point sources of wastes, pollution in one spot
- When wastes are not properly managed, when wastewater is not treated when air pollution is not controlled, ecological conditions in cities quickly become terrible

## Environmental realities of suburbs
- The least energy-efficient form of human settlement
- Per capita resource use, MSW and pollution generation by suburbanites is tremendous
- Suburbs are viable only because fossil fuels are inexpensive
- The long-term viability of suburbs will depend on finding affordable transportation alternatives

## Environmentally problematic urbanization
- Density is too low to support public transportation, and walking to work/school
- Creates a high rate of per capita energy consumption
- Density is too high to provide adequate greenspace, natural habitat

## Steps to urban sustainability
In low-income countries:
- Improve access to permanent comfortable shelter
- Improve sanitation
In high-income countries
- Reducing air and water quality problems
- Managing solid waste
- Improving public transportation and housing stocks
- Maintaining aging infrastructure
- Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
- Providing adequate housing for the poor

## Transportation
- In most urban cities the philosophy has been that cars take priority over everything else
- Cities must stop spreading outward and start becoming more dense
- In a sustainable city the priority should be:
	1. Pedestrian
	2. Cyclists
	3. Public transport
	4. commercial vehicles
	5. personal cars

## How do we achieve sustainable transport?
- Build it
	- Waterloo Region is constructing a light rail network in Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge
	- Costs $800m to make
- Road Pricing: Make car drivers pay the true price of using city streets
- Lane allocation
	- Primary traffic lanes are reserved for busses and taxis
	- Bicycles have dedicated lanes so they don't conflict with pedestrians or larger vehicles car lanes are allocated by # of occupants
- Ban private cars from city centers altogether
- Planning
	- From the outset, new developments must be planned with an integrated transportation system in mind, with pedestrians at the center

## Smart growth
- The reality is that more and more people will live in cities
- Must plan to accommodate them wisely and sustainably
- Smart growth uses planning to achieve ecological, economic and social sustainability

## Smart growth in practice
- set limits on sprawl, new development
- Create minimum standards for % of green space
- Encourage mixed land use
- Post-WWII planning was to separate industrial, commercial, and residential land and use in a grid pattern, ignoring natural features
- New urbanism encourages clusters of mixed development with lots of green space around
- Tax land uses that are unsustainable more heavily than those that are sustainable
- E.g. heavier taxes on suburban developments, lower taxes on in-fills
- Prioritize revitalization and renewal; treat the city as a collection of villages & neighbourhoods

## Why don't we embrace smart growth?
- Dumb growth is easier and cheaper to build
- A lot of people make a lot of $ from dumb growth and don't want to change
- A lot of people like dumb growth
- A lot of people have never lived in anything else, and don't know what they're missing
