# Lecture 1: Climate Change Causes and Impacts
## Part 1: How climate works
### Weather vs climate

Climate processes are driven by solar radiation
### Energy Balance
- Over the long term, the amount of solar energy coming into the atmosphere must be equal to the amount leaving the Earth's atmosphere
- Incoming 
	- solar radiation averages 342 W/m^2
- Outgoing
	- reflected off tops of clouds and shiny surfaces back to space = 107 W/m^2
	- Absorbed by gasses in the atmosphere = 67 W/m62
	- Absorbed by Earth surgace = 168 W/m^2
	- This 235 W/m^2 gets re-radiated back into space
- Incoming = Outgoing

### The greenhouse effect
- naturally occurring process that moderates the earth's surface temperature, making it warmer than it otherwise would be
- Creates a range of surface temperatures suitable to living creatures

#### How it works
- Certain gases found in trace amounts in the atmosphere, trap, absorb and re-radiate long-wave radiation
- These gases cause the greenhouse effect and are called greenhouse gases (GHGs)

#### GHGs and their concentrations
- Water vapour (about 1% of total atmospheric volume but varies considerably over time and pace)
- Carbon dioxide (415ppm)
- Methane (1.91ppm)
- Nitrous oxide (0.336)
- CFCs (.001 ppm)

### Oceans help redistribute heat around the globe
- More incoming solar radiation arrives at the equator than at other poles
- Ocean currents help redistribute the heat

Fort Severn avg temp = -14ºC
Glasgow avg temp = 7ºC
North Atlantic drift is a surface current that brings warm water from the tropics to the NW coast of Europe
Gives the UK, and Scandinavia warmer climates than Canada on the same latitude

### Hottest years
- The hottest years on record have all occurred since 2010
- Instrumentally recorded temperature records date back to the mid-1800s

### Factors that influence the climate
- The Earth's orbit
	- Causes seasonal changes throughout the year

#### Milankovitch variations
- Earth's orbit is an ellipse that varies (~100,000 years)
- The angle of the tilt of the earth varies over time (~40,000 years)
- The earth wobbles on its axis (~26,000 years)

These cycles added together influence the solar distribution on the earth
These are the causes of ice ages

#### Fluctuations in solar activity also affect climate
e.g. sunspots
- The amount of radiation the Earth receives from the sun is generally consistent
- Occasionally there are sunspots/solar flares that temporarily increase the amount of radiation the Earth receives

#### Volcanic activity affects climate
- Produces large amounts of smoke, particulates that temporarily block incoming radiation, cool the climate
- Can also produce greenhouse gasses that warm the climate
- Not a lot of volcanic activity in the last two centuries

#### Naturally Occurring factors are not responsible
- Average global temperatures would be roughly the same today as they were in 1850 if volcanos, solar flares, and Milankovitch cycles were the only factor
- Human activities are responsible for global warming

###  Where is carbon stored?
- Atmosphere in gasses
- Biomass
- fossilized
- dissolved in oceans

Humans are redistributing the natural storage of carbon by doing things like burning fossil fuels and making cement

### Carbon sinks
- Land vegetation, ocean direct absorption, and plankton remove the amount of carbon from the air
- Human activity makes more carbon than these carbon sinks can naturally remove from the air
