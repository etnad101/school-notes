# Lecture 1:  Energy Part 1 - Conventional Sources
![[Energy]]

## 3 types of energy
Kinetic = when matter is moving
Potential = not in use at this moment but could be released
Electromagnetic Radiation = waves of energy that are emitted and passed through space

Nuclear energy - a spontaneous change of the nucleus of an atom, usually done with uranium fission

## 2 Laws of thermodynamics
### New energy can not be spontaneously created or destroyed
- We can take existing forms of energy and cause them to change form or transfer it from one place to another (e.g. potential to kinetic)
- Humans cannot make new energy
- We also cannot destroy energy, but we can waste it

### When energy changes from one form to another there is a loss of efficiency
- we can never gain additional energy when we change it from one form to another
- we cannot even end up with equal amount of energy
- some energy is always wasted
- we can't have 100% efficiency

Traditional incandescent bulbs only use about 5% of incoming electricity to produce light, the rest is wasted as heat.

## Energy consumption
Canada has the highest energy consumption per capita
over 80% of energy is made from fossil fuels

### Coal
- used primarily as fuel to generate electricity
- Abundant in North America, Asia, Australia, Europe & Russia
- Scarce in Africa and South America

### Oil
- Most common use = transportation
- Also used as a feedstock for plastics and a wide range of synthetic products
- Also burned for heating
- Abundant in the Middle East, the Americas
- limited reserves in Europe, Africa, and Asia

### Natural Gas
- Burned to heat homes, heat water, cook foods
- Also used in thermal generating stations to produce electricity
- Feedstock for fertilizers, chemicals, and some plastics
- Large quantities

## Important global energy patterns
- consumption of energy is growing most rapidly in Asia
- Asia has low reserves of oil, and natural gas, but lots of coal
- North America has large reserves of all types of fossil fuels and has high rates of consumption
- Middle East has large reserves of oil and gas, but relatively few people so they export most
- Russia has lots of natural Gas, coal
- Western Europe has coal, and must import oil & natural gas
- Central and South America have oil, some natural gas
- Africa has overall limited reserves of fossil fuels of all types and these tend to be concentrated in only a few countries: Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola

## Environmental Impacts of fossil fuels
Impacts occur at
- Extraction
- Transportation
- Use

### Environmental impacts of coal mines
- 2 types of mines: Shaft & open pit
- Shafts are very dangerous
- Open pit is safer, easier, cheaper, but incredibly damaging to forests, downstream waterways, biodiversity
- Mining releases large amounts of sediments, potential toxins, metals
- Risk of water contamination downslope from mountaintop mines
- Risk of flooding for communities downstream

### Environmental impacts of burning coal
- Coal emits more greenhouse gasses per unit of energy than other fossil fuels
- Coal emits more air pollutants than other fossil fuels

### Environmental impacts from extraction & transportation of oil/gas
- Vary according to where extraction/transportation happen
- spills from offshore oil rigs and tanker ships are harmful to wildlife

2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill
- cost US$65 billion to clean up
- surface coastal areas have recovered but the ocean floor is still mostly lifeless

### Pipeline spills, Rail accidents
- Ruptured Enbridge pipeline, Kalamazoo, MI, 2010
- cost US$1.2B to clean up
- released toxins into the river contaminating water downstream

- Runaway train with 74 cars of oil crashed into town
- killed 47 people

### Oil refineries
- Generate contaminated wastewater and air pollution

## Alberta Tar Sands
### How oil is extracted
- Oil is contained in tar-like material called "bitumen"
- Either dug up via open pit mines OR hot steam is injected into the ground to loosen up the bitumen and pump it to the surface

### Upgrading bitumen
- at an upgrading facility, steam is used to remove sand from the bitumen
- chemicals are to make the bitumen more liquid so it can be transported via pipelines to refinery facilities
- This is known as "heavy oil", mixed with higher quality oil to make products.

### Inefficient, expensive polluting
- Approximately 1 unit of crude oil is produced for every 15 units of tar sand unearthed
- The process is extremely energy-intensive and uses large amounts of water
- Not cost-effective when oil prices are low

### Why do we do it
- Money
- Suncor is the largest company in the tar sands
- in the 2nd quarter of 2023 it reported net earnings of $1.3billion

### Unremediated mines and wells
Remediation = clean up after a well is emptied
Must:
1. remove toxins from the site
2. cap and seal pipes and wells
3. revegetate site
In Canada, companies try to delay or avoid remediating abandoned mines and wells; some declare bankruptcy to avoid paying cleanup costs
there are 170k abandoned oil wells in Alberta.

## Canadian energy use
### Supply of energy in Canada by source
- 35% natural gas
- 35% crude oil and ngls
- 11% hydro
- 9% nuclear
- 6% coal
- 5% biofuels and waste
- 1% other renewables

### Energy use in Canada
- 29% natural gas
- 20% electricity
- 18% motor gasoline
- 15% oil
- 9% other oil products
- 6% biomass
- 3% other

## One critical piece of technology
- We need to produce a lot more electricity
- 2 key ways of generating
	- Turbines
	- Photovoltaic panels

### Turbines
- Transform kinetic energy into a more usable form

## Nuclear Power
- Very expensive
- used in countries with sophisticated technology sectors

### Environmental impacts
Uranium is the most

# Lecture 2: Energy Part 2 - Alternative Energy
## Electricity distribution model in Ontario
- Large amounts of electricity are generated at single points
	- Nuclear plants
	- Thermal generating stations
	- hydroelectric generating stations
- Distributed by a network of wires

## Ontario electricity consumption patterns
- consumers use less electricity at night and on weekends
- more electricity used on hot summer days than any other time of the year (for air conditioning)
- The amount of electricity used at midday is referred to as the peak load
- The minimum amount of electricity needed in the middle of the night is the baseload
- Grid must be able to be flexible to handle fluctuations
- 
For the grid to meet baseload+peakload
- one that can operate all the time, cheaply and efficiently (e.g. nuclear & hydroelectric) are great for baseload
- Ones that can be turned on and off again as needed (hydeo, thermal)
- the grid has little storage capacity so electricity must be used and generated in real-time

## Alternatives to fossil fuels
- Hydroelectric
- nuclear
- wind
- solar
- biomass
-  biofuel
- hydrogen

### Hydroelectric generation
- Water flows past a turbine, generating electricity
- Often stored behind a dam to ensure a year-round steady supply of electricity
- Chaudiere Falls hydro generating station generates enough electricity for 24,000 homes

For every bird killed by a turbine, 5820 are killed by striking glass windows in tall buildings

Best practices for wind turbines
- Allow local people to invest in & profit from wind turbines
- make sure they are far enough away from houses to avoid causing annoyance

### Biomass energy
- Refers to burning any number of combustible organic materials to generate heat
- Biomass fuels used in the home can include firewood, charcoal, coffee grounds, cattle dung, wastepaper
- Large amounts can be used to fuel turbines

| Benefits                                             | Costs                                                    |

## The ability to store large amounts of electricity for later use
- Storage technologies lag far behind generation technologies
- Current batteries require large amounts of metals, elements that create environmental problems of their own

- The baseload requirement of the grid model is too great for non-fossil fuel, non-nuclear to meet alone
- Need more local, small-scale tie-ins to the grid

## How do we transition away from gas and diesel fuel
### Energy portability
- North American transportation model: majority of people get around using private automobiles
- public transportation and active transportation are not well-used
- gasoline-powered vehicles rea cheap and widespread
- gasoline is cheap, powerful, and portable

### Electric vehicles
- more expensive than gas gars
- the range is not as great as gas cars
- finding a charging station + time to charge
- batteries are expensive and have environmental impacts of their own
- once purchased operating costs are low
- electric power can be generated. without producing GHG emissions, unlike gasoline

### Hydrogen-powered cars
- Fuel cell technology already exists
- when hydrogen fuel is used, the tailpipe emissions = water
- Challenge: How to produce liquid hydrogen cheaply, efficiently and without creating GHG emissions

#### Greed Hydrogen
- can be separated from water using electrolysis
- process requires electricity
- if you get electricity from non-fossil fuel generators, you have no GHG emissions

### Public transportation
- Hydrogen-powered trains are already in use in Europe
