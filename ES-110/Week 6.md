# Lecture 1:  Human Food Systems
## Definitions
![[Food]]
![[Agriculture]]

- The food we eat is the result of complex interactions of human & ecological systems operating across vast geographical areas and multiple time scales

## Demand for food
3 key factors driving global demand:
1. Population growth in low-income countries
2. Number of calories demanded per person is increasing
3. Dietary preferences are changing

## How humans fed themselves over time
3 key stages in the evolution of human food systems
1. Hunting, gathering, scavenging
2. Subsistence agriculture (domestication of plants & animals)
3. Commercial agriculture

### Stage 1
- Tool-making hominids first appeared 3m years ago
- humans were opportunistic hunters/gatherers/scavengers until only 12,000 years ago

#### Modern hunting/gathering
- Most fish are still wild-caught
- As wild fish stocks dwindle, the amount of 'farmed' fish and shellfish is growing

### Stage 2
- Believed to have started 12,000 years ago
- people began experimenting with growing crops in at least 4 locales: the Middle East, East Asia, Central America, Andes

#### Farm animal domestication:
- sheep, goats domesticated 8000 years ago
- Llama, alpaca in Peru, 6,000 years ago  
- Cattle in Eurasia 6,000 years ago  
- Other animals followed later

#### Benefits of agriculture
- farmers produce large, more predictable quantities of food
- Allows for larger families
- Birth rates increased

#### Traditional farming methods
- Over thousands of years, through trial and error, farmers developed considerable environmental knowledge
- Traditional farmers are very knowledgeable about nutrient cycling, water conservation, soil protection
- Farming was often combined with hunting, fishing, forestry and other subsistence activities to ensure stable livelihoods

#### Subsistence agriculture in difficult environments
- in areas with poor soil or limited rainfall, other subsistence good produciton methods are practices
- E.g swidden agriculture in tropical environments, pastoralism in drylands and mountains

### Stage 3
- Farmers produce food for a global food marketplace, instead of for themselves
- Became possible because of technological developments
- Began in the early 20th century

#### Industrialization of food production
- A whole array of technologies were added to farms that reduced the need for human labour and draft animals
- Led to huge per-acre increases in food produced

#### Irrigation and drainage
- Irrigation allows dry-land regions to be brought into production
- Reduces the risks of losing crops to drought
- Mechanized pumps and drainage systems allow wetlands to be converted into agricultural land

#### Chemical fertilizers
- farmers no longer need to keep livestock to gain access to fertilizer
- chemical fertilizers allow farmers to add high levels of nutrients (N, P) to soil on a regular, convenient basis
- Allows marginal quality land to be brought into production

#### Chemical pesticides
- Traditional farmers had a mix of many crops and livestock
- This diversity protected farmers against losses due to pests
- Today chemical pesticides reduce pest damage, allowing farmers to specialize

#### Chemical herbicides
- Reduce the amount of plowing, and weeding needed
- Benefits: less labour is needed, crop yields go up

#### Monoculture copping
- Use of chemical herbicides & pesticides allows farms to specialize and use large volumes of a single crop

#### Experimentation with crop varieties
- Selective breeding & hybridization of high-producing plant varieties
- Develops more drought-tolerant, pest-resistant varieties
- makes plants easier to harvest
- Improves nutrition, appearance
- Leads to higher-yield crops

## Developments in food transportation & storage
- before the 1940s most towns in Ontario had dairies and cold storage facilities where residents stored their meat
- Cheap refrigeration allowed perishable food to be transferred over long distances

## Modern food = Ancient food, prepared differently
- The eaten today was domesticated thousands of years ago

## The history of the potato
- First domesticated in peru 7,000 years ago
- Over 5,000 varieties of potatoes are still grown in the Andes
- Quickly adopted by Europeans as a basic food stable
- Grows well in almost any type of soil, suitable for cool climates, easy to store & transport without refrigeration

## Positive outcomes of commercial agriculture
- Price of food as % of household expenditure fell sharply in high-income countries
- Crop yields in 20th century grew faster than the human population grew, meaning there was (until recently) more food available per person
- Nutrition improved 
- consumer choice improved
- Less labour needed for farming
