# Lecture 1:  Human Food Systems
## Definitions
![[Food]]
![[Agriculture]]

- The food we eat is the result of complex interactions of human & ecological systems operating across vast geographical areas and multiple time scales

## Demand for food
3 key factors driving global demand:
1. Population growth in low-income countries
2. Number of calories demanded per person is increasing
3. Dietary preferences are changing

## How humans fed themselves over time
3 key stages in the evolution of human food systems
1. Hunting, gathering, scavenging
2. Subsistence agriculture (domestication of plants & animals)
3. Commercial agriculture

### Stage 1
- Tool-making hominids first appeared 3m years ago
- humans were opportunistic hunters/gatherers/scavengers until only 12,000 years ago

#### Modern hunting/gathering
- Most fish are still wild-caught
- As wild fish stocks dwindle, the amount of 'farmed' fish and shellfish is growing

### Stage 2
- Believed to have started 12,000 years ago
- people began experimenting with growing crops in at least 4 locales: the Middle East, East Asia, Central America, Andes

#### Farm animal domestication:
- sheep, goats domesticated 8000 years ago
- Llama, alpaca in Peru, 6,000 years ago  
- Cattle in Eurasia 6,000 years ago  
- Other animals followed later

#### Benefits of agriculture
- farmers produce large, more predictable quantities of food
- Allows for larger families
- Birth rates increased

#### Traditional farming methods
- Over thousands of years, through trial and error, farmers developed considerable environmental knowledge
- Traditional farmers are very knowledgeable about nutrient cycling, water conservation, soil protection
- Farming was often combined with hunting, fishing, forestry and other subsistence activities to ensure stable livelihoods

#### Subsistence agriculture in difficult environments
- in areas with poor soil or limited rainfall, other subsistence good produciton methods are practices
- E.g swidden agriculture in tropical environments, pastoralism in drylands and mountains

### Stage 3
- Farmers produce food for a global food marketplace, instead of for themselves
- Became possible because of technological developments
- Began in the early 20th century

#### Industrialization of food production
- A whole array of technologies were added to farms that reduced the need for human labour and draft animals
- Led to huge per-acre increases in food produced

#### Irrigation and drainage
- Irrigation allows dry-land regions to be brought into production
- Reduces the risks of losing crops to drought
- Mechanized pumps and drainage systems allow wetlands to be converted into agricultural land

#### Chemical fertilizers
- farmers no longer need to keep livestock to gain access to fertilizer
- chemical fertilizers allow farmers to add high levels of nutrients (N, P) to soil on a regular, convenient basis
- Allows marginal quality land to be brought into production

#### Chemical pesticides
- Traditional farmers had a mix of many crops and livestock
- This diversity protected farmers against losses due to pests
- Today chemical pesticides reduce pest damage, allowing farmers to specialize

#### Chemical herbicides
- Reduce the amount of plowing, and weeding needed
- Benefits: less labour is needed, crop yields go up

#### Monoculture copping
- Use of chemical herbicides & pesticides allows farms to specialize and use large volumes of a single crop

#### Experimentation with crop varieties
- Selective breeding & hybridization of high-producing plant varieties
- Develops more drought-tolerant, pest-resistant varieties
- makes plants easier to harvest
- Improves nutrition, appearance
- Leads to higher-yield crops

## Developments in food transportation & storage
- before the 1940s most towns in Ontario had dairies and cold storage facilities where residents stored their meat
- Cheap refrigeration allowed perishable food to be transferred over long distances

## Modern food = Ancient food, prepared differently
- The eaten today was domesticated thousands of years ago

## The history of the potato
- First domesticated in Peru 7,000 years ago
- Over 5,000 varieties of potatoes are still grown in the Andes
- Quickly adopted by Europeans as a basic food stable
- Grows well in almost any type of soil, suitable for cool climates, easy to store & transport without refrigeration

### Nutrition facts (Medium potato)
- 100 calories
- 26g carbohydrates
- 3g fibre
- 23g sugar
- 4g protein
- Calcium 2% DV  
- Iron 6% DV  
- Vitamin C 45% DV

## Positive outcomes of commercial agriculture
- Price of food as % of household expenditure fell sharply in high-income countries
- Crop yields in the 20th century grew faster than the human population grew, meaning there was (until recently) more food available per person
- Nutrition improved 
- consumer choice improved
- Less labour is needed for farming

## Future demand for food
- projected by the year 2050 we will need to produce 30-50% more food than today to keep up with global demand

## Stage 4 - Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
- The next stage of food production
### Benefits
- Allows plants and animals to grow faster and yield more food
- allows plants to last longer without spoiling
- resistant to common pests
- more tolerant of environmental stresses like salinization and drought
- improve nutrition value
- add desirable qualities like vitamins and vaccines
- GM animals can be made to grow faster and provide more protein
### Risks
- No evidence of human health risks in the short-term
- If GMOs get into the wild, how they will affect native species is uncertain
- Ethical questions about animal welfare
- poor farmers often can't afford GMO technology

## Stage 5 - Lab-grown meat

# Lecture 2: Soils, sustainability, food security

## Photosynthesis
- Plants use C, H, O, N, P, S and other elements to create complex organic material
- The first step is to make glucose via photosynthesis
- Chlorophyll is where this happens

### Reaction 1
Keeps 2 hydrogens from water
expels one oxygen

### Reaction 2
Takes 6 molecules of  carbon dioxide and breaks them apart
expels water oxygen
expels wastewater
makes one glucose molecule (C6-H12-O6)

## What do plants need to grow?
- Air
- water
- sunlight
- favourable temperatures
- Nutrients from soil

## What is soil
- a mixture of organic material, inorganic material, and living organisms
- one of our most critical resources
- Being destroyed around the world

### Soil profile
- O Horizon - Humus (plant litter, other decomposing organic material)
- A Horizon - Topsoil (mix of humus and leached mineral soil)
- B Horizon - Subsoil (accumulation of leached minerals e.g. iron & aluminum oxides)
- C Horizon - Weathered parent material (partly broken down rock)
- R Horizion - Parent material (rock)

### Canadian Prairie soils
- Chernozem: dark soil associated with grasslands
- typically very fertile, workable
- widespread across Canadian prairies

### Soil particle size
- sand 0.02 - 2 mm
- silt 0.002 - 0.02 mm
- clay microscopic
### Important characteristics
- larger particles have more space between them
- smaller particles have a greater portion of surface area relative to volume
- water and nutrients tend to cling to surfaces

- compacted soil lacks pore space for movement of water, air and nutrients

### Organisms in the soil
- break down organic material on the surface creating humus
- create concentrated particles containing nutrients and minerals

### Good agricultural soil
- mix of organix material + inorganic particles
- ability to hold water
- allows movement of air and roots
- nutrients and minerals available
- neutral PH
- low salt

### Nutrients for plant growth
- plants require nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) to grow
- manure and fertilizer are used to add these to the soil
### How plants get nitrogen
- need nitrogen to grow
- nots of nitrogen in the air but plants absorb it through their roots
- bacteria in the soil is how plants get nitrogen
- certain plants stimulate the growth of nitrogen-fixing bacteria

## Environmental impacts of industrial food production
- Deforestation, land conversion
- soil erosion, land degradation
- damage to waterways
- damage to ecosystems from agro-chemicals
- increased fossil fuel demands
- antibiotic resistance

### Conversion of forests to farmland & grazing
- causes loss in biodiversity, impacts the hydrological cycle

### Soil erosion
- The organic material, clay & silt in topsoil are light
- when the topsoil is exposed to wind and rain the light components are easily removed
- without them soil fertility plummets
- over-irrigation leads to the salinization of soil

### Contamination of soil & water by agricultural chemicals

### Ag contributes to climate change
- Global food systems create <1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions
- clearance of forests for farmland reduces CO2 absorption
- Farm machinery, and fertilizer use a lot of fossil fuels
- livestock herds generate methane
- transportation, refrigeration, and processing all consume fossil fuels
- Beef cattle produce 99.48 kg of CO2 per kg of beef produced, More than any other animal/crop

### Antibiotic-resistant pathogens
- Confining large numbers of livestock, and poultry in small areas makes them susceptible to diseases
- many farms dose animals with antibiotics meant for human use
- over time disease pathogens evolve to be antibiotic-resistant

## Pathways to sustainable agricultural systems
- Better land management to avoid soil erosion  
- Fewer monoculture farms, more polyculture farms  
- More use of technology (precision agriculture)  
- Better water, and nutrient management on farms  
- Perennialization of grain crops  
- Reduce the use of chemicals, return to more organic production  
- Change consumer preferences in high-income countries  
- Renewed focus on the production of local foods for local consumers  
- More urban food production  
- Reduce food wastage

### Avoid soil erosion
- minimize soil disturbance
- plant [[shelterbelts]]
- Better water use and management
- Conservation tillage
	- Seeds are drilled into the soil
	- alternative to plowing

### Improve soil nutrients
- Improving soil nutrients with intercropping
- Soil nutrient conservation with crop rotation and fallow cover

### Polyculture farming
- integrates multiple crops, livestock, and poultry in a closed-loop system
- maximized overall per-acre productivity while minimizing chemicals
- more sophisticated and intensive than monoculture farming
### Precision agriculture
- use of technology to be more precise about irrigation, application of fertilizers, chemicals
### Improving water efficiency in farming
- Select crop types appropriate for the local climate to minimize the need for irrigation
- irrigate wisely
### Perennializaiton
