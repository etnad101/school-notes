# Lecture 1: Climate Change Mitigation
## Mitigation
- Mitigation = human intervention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases
- The IPCC warned that we must limit the global average temperature rise to no more than 1.5ºC higher than pre-industrial temperatures
- even an extra 0.5ºC would have severe consequences
- To limit warming to 1.5ºC we would need to have nearly 0 emissions in the next 2-3 decades
- Likely to reach 1.5ºC between 2030 and 2052 if it continues at the current rate

## Differences between 1.5 and 2
- at +2 coral reefs start to disappear from the planet entirely
- The Arctic Ocean would likely be ice-free in the summer at least once a decade
- severe flooding risk increases by 50% for every 0.5ºC of extra warming

## Paris Climate Agreement
- Negotiated in 2015, signed by most nations
- promise to work together to constrain global warming to no more than +2ºC
- all countries have GHG emission reduction targets

## Options for reducing GHG emissions
- Reducing GHG emissions at the source
- expanding capacity of carbon sinks
- Also the possibility of new technology to capture and store carbon

## Mitigation challenges
- emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes are 78% of total GHG emissions
- Annual growth in GHG emissions paused in 2020 but has now resumed
- key drivers are economic growth and population increase

## 7 key things that need to change
### Energy systems must eliminate GHG emissions
- Key energy sources of the future will need to be based on electricity that i generated in ways that don't require the burning of fossil fuels
- Options = hydro, solar, wind, nuclear
#### Carbon capture and storage
- idea is to capture C02 being emitted from the smokestack as we burn fossil fuel and put it back into the ground
- Still in development but has not proven useful yet

### The transport sector must have 0 emissions
- Currently accounts for 27% of all GHG emissions globally
- Requires
	- No more gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles
	- Big investments in urban public transportation
	- High-speed rail connections to replace short-haul airplane flights
	- Greater use of green hydrogen as fuel for vehicles
	- Making cities better for walking/biking

#### Option 1: ban internal combustion vehicles
- California, Canada and most European countries plan to end the sale of gas-powered autos in the 2030s

#### Option 2: give buyers incentives to buy ZEVs
- Govt of Canada offers $5000 rebate on new zero emissions vehicle purchase
- BC and Quebec add extra incentives of up to $8000

#### Option 3: Give auto manufacturers incentives to build more ZEVs
- Supply of ZEVs is low
- Governments in NA, and EU are giving automakers taxpayer money to build more ZEVs for cheaper

### Buildings must be more energy-efficient
- account for about 325 of all energy use
- Requires better insulation, efficient lighting, and energy-efficient appliances
- Pays off in the long run

### Industry must be more energy efficient
- Accounts for 28% of global energy use
- many challenges, since industries are so diverse
- All solutions require becoming more energy-efficient
- Measure = "energy intensity", Energy used per unit made

### GHG emissions from agriculture and forestry must be reduced
- accounts for <25% of GHG emissions globally
- requires
	- Afforestation and sustainable forest management
	- Sustainable agriculture that maximizes soil conservation, water management
	- consumer food choices must change (less meat, more veggies)

### Urban development must become sustainable
- Need greater density of housing, closer proximity to employment and residential
- Better public transportation
- Smaller and mid-sized cities are of growing importance

### Governments must help make the preceding 6 steps happen
- Requires
	- Policies that reward mitigation and limit emissions of GHG emissions
	- Financing mechanisms to make energy transition possible
	- Identifying opportunities for co-benefits
	- Voters to stop electing politicians who refuse to be part of the solution

## Scales where mitigation happens
### International scale
- UNFCCC actions
	- First big step = the Kyoto protocol, signed at COP3 (1997)
	- Industrialized countries and "Economies in transition" Collectively agreed to reduce their emissions to 5% below 1990 levels by the year 2012
	- China, India, Brazil and low-income countries were not required to make GHG emission cuts
	- Each country was given an emissions reduction target
- Paris Agreement
	- Canada to reduce GHG emissions by 40% of 2005 emissions levels by 2030
	- Needs to be reduced to 0 by 2050
