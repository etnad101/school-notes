# Lecture 1: What Canada is doing about climate change; environmental health
Chapter 16 in the textbook
Do not need to read 'Risk assessment for toxins' at end of section 16-4
Don't need to read 'Making a Difference' at the end of chapter 16

## In the news
- Canada is not on track to meet GHG emission reduction goals by 2030

## Key elements in to government's 2030 plan
- Carbon tax
- Rules requiring that all new vehicles be ZECs by 2035
- A cap on GHG emissions from the energy sector (TBD)
- $458M for home energy savings
- $2.2b for green energy
- $2.6b for ZEVs + charging infrastructure
- $850m for improving the electrical grid
- Tax credits for carbon capture & storage products

## Why should Canada be expected to reduce its GHG emissions?
- Canada's GHG emissions per capita are triple the global average

## Climate change-related work prof does
- IPCC
- Environmental migration & displacement research
- Citizen science

### What is the IPCC?
- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change formed in 1988
- UN-sponsored organization of volunteer scientists who generate regular reports for the community

#### What is the purpose?
- Governments use the IPCC reports as a basis for negotiating UNFCCC
- Researchers, governments, NGOs, media, the informed public, and others rely heavily on IPCC reports for info about climate change
- IPCC reports are translated into multiple UN languages

### Climate refugees
- There is a growing concern that hundreds of millions of people worldwide may be displaced by extreme weather & rising sea levels in the coming decades
- Last week Australia & Tuvalu signed a migration accord
- By the end of this century, Tuvalu may not be habitable due to sea level rise, storms
- By 2050, the World Bank projects that up to 216 million people could be displaced from their homes from a combination of climate change & poverty if we don't change the path we're on

## Definitions
Health: the absence of disease or impairment
Wellbeing: a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease
Most sources tend to use both to mean the same thing, but there is a difference

## Determinants of health
- Causal Factor - infectious agent or condition transmissibility, pathogenicity, virulence
- (Social) Environment
- Host

## How do we measure in general terms of health and/or well-being of people?
Common measures include:
- Life expectancy at birth
- Healthy life expectancy (HALE) = the number of years of life expected to be lived in good health
- changes over time for both of the above

## Global inequity in health, wellbeing
- Global average life expectancy at birth in 2017 = 73 years
- Change in life expectancy from 1990 to 2017 = +7.4 years
- average HALE in 2017 = 63.3 years
- Change in HALE from 1990 to 2017 = +6.3 years
- Residents of high-income countries tend to have a longer life expectancy, and longer HALE than low-income countries

## Ways of measuring specific health outcomes
- Number of people who get sick (prevalence)
- Number of people who die (mortality)
- DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Year) = Number of years of health life lost (captures premature death, injury, disability, chronic illness, etc.)

## Measuring the impacts of malaria
- number of malaria cases globally in 2021: 241m
- number of malaria-related deaths recorded in 2021: 627,000
- Global DALYs attributable to malaria 339,298,000
- Malaria rates rising again

## Linkages between environment and health
- Environmental conditions can influence rates of non-infectious and infectious diseases
- In both cases, human activity can have a significant influence, through such pathways as air pollution, water pollution, and the release of toxins

## Health and Well-being in a Changing Climate
Risks to physical health
- Higher rates of malnutrition in low-income countries due to disruptions in food systems
- wider spread of water-borne diseases

## Countries experiencing high rates of malnutrition
- Southeast Asia and India have higher rates of malnutrition
- Parts of the Middle East and Africa also have higher rates

## Indicators of childhood malnutrition
- Stunting = impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition
- Measure = childs height-for-age is >2 standard deviations below average
- Wasting = child is to thing for height due to malnutrition
- Measure = child's weight

### Impacts of stunting and wasting
- Poor cognition and educational performance
- low adult wages
- lost productivity
- increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adult life

## Physical health risks & climate change
- worst risks of climate change are likely to manifest as impacts on health, wellbeing
- Some individuals and groups are more vulnerable than others
- E.g. the poor, elderly, children, pregnant people

## Impacts of climate change on heat-related illnesses and deaths
- Risk level depends on the amount of adaptation

## What are key adaptations?
- Support universal public health systems in Canada and abroad
- End food insecurity in low-income countries
- Build disease early warning systems
- Build water & sanitation infrastructure
- Eliminate conditions that host disease vectors

## Climate change and mental health
- V = f(E,S,A)
- Vulnerability
- Exposure
- Sensitivity
- Adaptation

### Exposure risks
Example of direct exposure
- People who experience extreme weather events, or famine can then experience PTSDm chronic depression
- Extreme heat can lead to temporarily higher rates of people seeking treatment for behavioural disorders & acute anxiety; anti-social behaviour/violence; suicide
Example of indirect vicious exposure:
- Lost household income/livelihoods due to climate events
- Seeing close friends or family lose things due to climate events

### Solastalgia 
- climate anxiety, eco-anxiety
- Emerging research shoes that growing awareness of climate change , environmental risks is causing higher levels of anxiety among young people
How do we address this?
- Supporting collective social action & networks of young people seeking environmental action, justice
