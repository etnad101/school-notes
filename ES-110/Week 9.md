Do not need to read 'Risk assessment for toxins' at end of section 16-4
Don't need to read 'Making a Difference' at the end of chapter 16

## In the news
- Canada is not on track to meet GHG emission reduction goals by 2030

## Key elements in to government's 2030 plan
- Carbon tax
- Rules requiring that all new vehicles be ZECs by 2035
- A cap on GHG emissions from the energy sector (TBD)
- $458M for home energy savings
- $2.2b for green energy
- $2.6b for ZEVs + charging infrastructure
- $850m for improving the electrical grid
- Tax credits for carbon capture & storage products

## Why should Canada be expected to reduce its GHG emissions?
- Canada's GHG emissions per capita are triple the global average

## Climate change-related work prof does
- IPCC
- Environmental migration & displacement research
- Citizen science

### What is the IPCC?
- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change formed in 1988
- UN-sponsored organization of volunteer scientists who generate regular reports for the community

#### What is the purpose?
- Governments use the IPCC reports as a basis for negotiating UNFCCC
- Researchers, governments, NGOs, media, the informed public, and others rely heavily on IPCC reports for info about climate change
- IPCC reports are translated into multiple UN languages

### Climate refugees
- There is a growing concern that hundreds of millions of people worldwide may be displaced by extreme weather & rising sea levels in the coming decades
- Last week Australia & Tuvalu signed a migration accord
- By the end of this century, Tuvalu may not be habitable due to sea level rise, storms
- By 2050, the World Bank projects that up to 216 million people could be displaced from their homes from a combination of climate change & poverty if we don't change the path we're on

## Definitions
Health: the absence of disease or impairment
Wellbeing: a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease
Most sources tend to use both to mean the same thing, but there is a difference

## Determinants of health
- Causal Factor - infectious agent or condition transmissibility, pathogenicity, virulence
- (Social) Environment
- Host

## How do we measure in general terms of health and/or well-being of people?
Common measures include:
- Life expectancy at birth
- Healthy life expectancy (HALE) = the number of years of life expected to be lived in good health
- changes over time for both of the above

## Global inequity in health, wellbeing
- Global average life expectancy at birth in 2017 = 73 years
- Change in life expectancy from 1990 to 2017 = +7.4 years
- average HALE in 2017 = 63.3 years
- Change in HALE from 1990 to 2017 = +6.3 years
- Residents of high-income countries tend to have a longer life expectancy, and longer HALE than low-income countries

## Ways of measuring specific health outcomes
- Number of people who get sick (prevalence)
- Number of people who die (mortality)
- DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Year) = Number of years of health life lost (captures premature death, injury, disability, chronic illness, etc.)

## Measuring the impacts of malaria
- number of malaria cases globally in 2021: 241m
- number of malaria-related deaths recorded in 2021: 627,000
- Global DALYs attributable to malaria 339,298,000
- Malaria rates rising again

## Linkages between environment and health
- Environmental conditions can influence rates of non-infectious and infectious diseases
- In both cases, human activity can have a significant influence, through such pathways as air pollution, water pollution, and the release of toxins

## Health and Well-being in a Changing Climate
Risks to physical health
- Higher rates of malnutrition in low-income countries due to disruptions in food systems
- wider spread of water-borne diseases

## Countries experiencing high rates of malnutrition
- Southeast Asia and India have higher rates of malnutrition
- Parts of the Middle East and Africa also have higher rates

## Indicators of childhood malnutrition
- Stunting = impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition
- Measure = childs height-for-age is >2 standard deviations below average
- Wasting = child is to thing for height due to malnutrition
- Measure = child's weight

### Impacts of stunting and wasting
- Poor cognition and educational performance
- low adult wages
- lost productivity
- increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adult life

## Physical health risks & climate change
- worst risks of climate change are likely to manifest as impacts on health, wellbeing
- Some individuals and groups are more vulnerable than others
- E.g. the poor, elderly, children, pregnant people

## Impacts of climate change on heat-related illnesses and deaths
- Risk level depends on the amount of adaptation

## What are key adaptations?
- Support universal public health systems in Canada and abroad
- End food insecurity in low-income countries
- Build disease early warning systems
- Build water & sanitation infrastructure
- Eliminate conditions that host disease vectors

## Climate change and mental health
- V = f(E,S,A)
- Vulnerability
- Exposure
- Sensitivity
- Adaptation

### Exposure risks
Example of direct exposure
- People who experience extreme weather events, or famine can then experience PTSDm chronic depression
- Extreme heat can lead to temporarily higher rates of people seeking treatment for behavioural disorders & acute anxiety; anti-social behaviour/violence; suicide
Example of indirect vicious exposure:
- Lost household income/livelihoods due to climate events
- Seeing close friends or family lose things due to climate events

### Solastalgia 
- climate anxiety, eco-anxiety
- Emerging research shows that growing awareness of climate change, and environmental risks is causing higher levels of anxiety among young people
How do we address this?
- Supporting collective social action & networks of young people seeking environmental action, justice

# Lecture 2: Environment & Health
## Non-infectious diseases
- Leading cause of DALY globally
- in high-income countries the main source of DALY before covid:
	- Cardiovascular disease
	- Cancers
	- Lung diseases (e.g asthma)
	- Diabetes

## Airborne toxins: a growing cause of non-infectious disease in many countries
Airborne toxins:
- Fine particulate matter, ground-level ozone
- Typically by-products of burning fossil fuels
- Exacerbate asthma, respiratory illness

## Waterborne toxins
- typically by-products of industrial activity
- are "persistent" (i.e. don't break down easily)
- Many are bio-accumulate
- many are "lipophilic" (i.e. accumulate in fatty tissues)
- Many are non-natural (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical pesticides)
- Also includes metals and arsenic
- we are exposed to them through food and water

### Challenges in measuring waterborne toxins
- Health impacts are difficult to quantify
- Data are often poor
- Many such toxins are "forever chemicals"

### Arsenic in groundwater in Bangladesh
- An estimated 20 million people in Bangladesh are exposed to high levels of arsenic through drinking water from wells
- Arsenic slowly poisons them
- Arsenic occurs naturally, and technologies exist to filter it out of water
- The rural poor lack money to employ these technologies

### Love Canal, Niagara Falls, New York
- Unlike the example of arsenic in Bangladesh, this was not a natural phenomenon
- Toxic chemicals were deliberately dumped toxins into the ground

#### Love Canal - Hooker chemicals
- Niagara Falls NY was home to many WWII-era chemical factories
- School and subdivision houses were built near a a toxic dumpsite sold by Hooker Chemicals to the city
- Residents experienced higher levels of cancers, birth defects, and neurological illness

### Grassy Narrows, ON - methylmercury poisoning
- in the 60s and 70s a chemical plant near Kenora dumped large amounts of mercury into Wibigoon River
- residents downstream have suffered from mercury poisoning ever since

#### Mercury poisoning
- When it is released into a water body, mercury accumulates in sediments, where natural processes convert it to methylmercury, a neurotoxin  
- Methylmercury accumulates in the tissues of fish and shellfish  
- Ingesting methylmercury causes neurological problems  
- Symptoms include numbness in fingers and toes, loss of vision, speech impairment, seizures, + coma and death in extreme cases  
- Pregnant mothers pass methylmercury to the fetus in the womb, leading to cognitive delays in children  

## Heat impacts on non-infectious diseases
- Extreme heat
- Raises the risk of cardiovascular disease, especially among older people
- Makes it more difficult to breathe exacerbating respiratory illness
- creates the risk of heat stroke and illness for people who exert themselves outdoor
- Can raise indoor temperatures to life-threatening levels in non-air-conditioned buildings

## Infectious diseases
- Transmission can occur directly from one person to another or through a vector

## Infectious disease and DALY
- impacts typically much greater in low-income countries than in high-income countries
- Often due to poor sanitation, poor housing, lack of access to basic health care, and poor diets (i.e. poverty)

## Viral diseases
- Viruses = organic matter neither living nor dead
- A virus inserts itself into the living  
cells of a host and uses the cell to  
make copies of itself  
- Examples include the common  
cold, West Nile, Ebola, polio,  
gastro-intestinal illnesses  
- COVID-19 = disease caused by a  

## Bacterial diseases
- Most bacteria are harmless to people (many are beneficial)

## Antibiotic resistance
- The effectiveness of antibiotic medicines may decrease in time as bacteria evolve
- Crowded poultry brands and animal feedlots are favourable to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the disease  

## Vector-borne diseases
- Transmission of the disease is not direct from person to person but via an intermediate organism (a “vector”)  
- Mosquitos, ticks, and fleas are the most common vectors  
- Common diseases include malaria, dengue, West Nile, Zika, Lyme, encephalitis

### What is malaria
- Disease caused by parasites that affect the bloodstream
- spread by mosquitos
- Symptoms = headache, abdominal pain, chills, shaking, fever and sweats  
- Outcomes include seizures, anemia, jaundice, heart failure, kidney failure, coma, death

#### Malaria distribution under climate change
- A 2º-3ºC increase in temperatures would expose hundreds of millions of people to malaria

#### Adaptation to malaria
- Avoid being bitten
- Not easy to avoid if you work outside
- Drain wet areas where mosquitos breed, spray insecticides  
- The first vaccine for malaria was made publicly available in 2021
### Lyme disease
- tick-borne disease
- causes loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches, neck stiffness, heart palpitations, joint pain and swelling, memory problems, and/or severe fatigue

#### Lyme disease cases reported in Canada
- Overall trend = rapid growth

#### Adaptation options to protect against Lyme disease
- no vaccines or methods of eradication exist
- when in tick habitat  wear long pants, long sleeves
- have a shower afterwards and check yourself
- check pets for ticks

## Zoonotic diseases
- Diseases that spread from other animals to humans
- Many of the diseases we are familiar with are zoonotic (e.g. influenza)
### What are the origins of SARS-CoV-2?
- name of the virus that causes COVID-19
- coronaviruses are common in other species and can jump on humans
- very similar to viruses found in bats
- scientists have not yet discovered any animals infected with this virus

### What we currently know about COVID-19
- The virus is transmitted primarily through airborne respiratory droplets and aerosols 
- most transmission occurs indoors, in spaces with poor air circulation
- virus not long lived outside of the host

### Vaccines for infectious diseases
- One of the greatest medical breakthroughs of the last century
- development of many vaccines in <12 months is a historic achievement

## Perceptions of risk
- People's perception of the risks offered does not match the actual statistical risk of contracting an illness or becoming seriously ill from it

## Solutions space for health = nature
- we can improve human health through better environmental practices and policies
- Pursue actions with Co-benefits
- E.g eliminate the burning of fossil fuels = reduce GHG emissions, air pollution, doctor visits for respiratory problems
- E.g. investments in sanitation eliminate waterborne disease and improve biodiversity

## Biophilia
- A psychological trait through which humans are subconsciously attracted to and feel an affiliation with plants, animals, and nature more generally
- When people are deprived of interaction with nature, it causes harm

## Nature disconnectedness or 'biophobia'
- some individuals may be fully disconnected or even afraid of engagement with nature
- maybe associated with nature deprivation as a child or some other trauma
- Outcome = higher rates of dissatisfaction with one's own life

## The theory behind "nature deficit disorder"
- Children best learn about the world in which they live through non-structured outdoor play
- It is important for their physical, emotional and spiritual development
- Lack of play in nature leads to a variety of mental and physical health challenges
- Not a clinical term

## ADHD
- A clinical condition that affects ~7% of all children
- Symptoms: persistent compulsivity, inability to focus, inability to follow instructions

## Links between ADHD and NDD
- Research shows that after age 2, children who live in rural environments are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD
- Other studies show symptoms of ADHD recede during nature-based play
- A small number but growing number of professionals are prescribing nature-based therapies for adults with mental health challenges

## Other ways nature improves human health
### Vitamin D
- The body requires vitamin D to regulate the amount of Calcium the body absorbs
- the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight

### Trees cool cities
### Gardening as therapy
- sunlight lowers blood pressure
- beneficial for diet
- increased dexterity and strength
- Various mental health benefits
	- Anxiety and stress reduction
	- Attention deficit recovery

### Nature helps us recover quicker from illness
- Repeated studies have shown that surgery patients who have a garden view tend to recover quicker
### Forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku)
- has psychological benefits
- boosts immune system

#### Phytoncides
- Chemicals produced by plants to ward off microbial, and fungal infections
- A small but growing body of research shows these have beneficial effects on human immune systems, sleep

## Do plants improve indoor air quality?
- Research is mixed
- plants may reduce NO2 levels in a room but not outdoor air pollution
- May introduce beneficial bacteria in a room
- Increase air humidity
- Provide similar mental health benefits as outdoor plants
