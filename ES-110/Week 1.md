## Anthropocene

![[Anthropocene]]

## Anthropogenic environmental change

![[Anthropogenic]]

[[Anthropogenic]] environmental change is accelerating at global, local, and regional scales.

Key reasons are:
- growing human population numbers
- growing levels of consumption of resources
- technological advances  that increase our ability to extract/consume resources also have adverse side-effects(pollution, climate change, etc)

## Huge benefits, Huge impacts

These changes have both environmental and economic impacts.

## Global human population is soaring

- Each year we add >2 Canadas worth of people to the globe
- For each person that dies, 3 babies are born

## Consumption

- People are consuming more resources than the earth can replenish naturally
- People are consuming more each year

## Pollution

- Air and water pollution levels in many locations around the world exceed safe levels for human health  

## Biodiversity loss: Mass extinction is underway, caused by humans

- One third of all known land vertebrate species are declining in numbers

## Forests are disappearing

- Deforestation and land degradation rates are high especially in low-income countries

## Climate Change

- Steady increase in global temperature due to burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, etc.
- Wildfires, flooding and heatwaves can all be caused by climate change

## Is a sustainable future possible

- Yes, but it won't happen automatically
- We need to make an effort
- There are solutions and pathways
- In Sweden, all levels of government deliberately plan for sustainability

Sustainability needs environmental protection, Economic prosperity, and social wellbeing.

## Sustainable Development Goals

- list of global "Millennium Development Goals"
- These were supplanted in 2015 by the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)

## How is the world doing

- The UN releases an SDG report each year in September
- We are way behind schedule in achieving most of the 17 goals
- for some goals progress has stalled or is even moving backward
- The Covid 19 pandemic led to higher levels of poverty, food insecurity, and many people/places have not yet recovered
