# Lecture 1: Human impacts on freshwater aquatic systems, oceans

## 2 Types of aquatic environments
1. Freshwater
2. Saltwater
Together cover 70% of the earth

## Freshwater aquatic systems
- Can be standing
- can be permanently wet 

### 2 important props of fresh water
1. Water is at its densest when the temperature is 4ºC
	- Means that water freezes from the surface downwards
2. Cold water contains more dissolved oxygen than warm water

### Dissolved oxygen (DO)
- Air can hold >200,000 ppm of oxygen
- Water holds about 10 ppm of dissolved oxygen at 15ºC
- Actual DO level depends on temperature
- Fish, shellfish species tend to die off if DO levels fall by more than half
- Cold water holds more DO than warm water per unit volume

## How humans impact freshwater systems
- Damming or diverting watercourses
- Draining wetlands and ephemeral ponds
- Changing the shore environment
- Chemical and nutrient pollution from industry farming
- Wastewater from homes/residences

### Impact of dams
- Alters water levels, flows above and below
- Changes water chemistry, temperature turbidity
- Prevents migratory species from moving up/down river

### Alterations of streams, ponds, rivers
- Increases flow of water into/through channels
- Removes habitat for insects, waterfowl, amphibians, reptiles, and fish

### Draining wetlands
- Wetlands collect surface drainage
- In Ontario vast majority of wetlands have been drained for farms and urban/suburban constructions
- Increase flood risk and reduce habitats

### Nutrient pollution of freshwater
- People add nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizers to farmland/gardens
- some get washed into waterways where it fertilizes the growth of algae -> water becomes less clear so temperatures rise -> oxygen levels fall -> changes in biodiversity occur

### Bioaccumulation and biomagnification
- Bio-accumulation: toxins in water accumulate in the tissues of living organisms
- Biomagnification: toxin concentration levels in the tissues become higher up the food chain.

### Common waterborne diseases
- Typhoid
- Cholera
- Salmonella
- Diarrhea
- Hepatitis A
- Poio
- Dysentery
- Giardia

## Global access to safe drinking water
- 2 billion people drink water that may be contaminated by feces
- 844 million people have no access to treated drinking water at all
- 144 million drink raw surface water
- 500k people die yearly from water-related illness
- In Canada, 28 First Nations communities have unsafe water advisories in place

## Dealing with water pollution
1. Resuce the production of pollution at the source
2. Collect polluted water and treat it

A key challenge is trying to prevent & capture "non-point-source" pollution

### Municipal sewage
- is 99% water and 1% waste
- Not all communities treat their sewage
- Until 2021 Victoria BC pumped raw sewage into the ocean
- Not all treat their sewage to the same degree

### Why do water problems persist in poorer countries
- low-income countries are former colonies of European powers that did not invest in sanitation
- Many countries lack the money to invest in sanitation, especially with rapidly growing cities
- Weak governments may be unable to fund enforcement/source water protection.

## Key section of chapter 10
- Ocean acidification
	- Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere gets slowly dissolved into ocean water at the surface
	- as CO2 emissions go up, more gets dissolved into the oceans, water becomes more acidic
- Impacts of fishing

### Impacts of acidity on shellfish
- Shells become damaged, bleached white as acidity increases
- Normal ocean pH ~8.1

### Impacts of fishing
- Doubled amount of fish production since 1960
- Over-exploitation of cod off Newfoundland in 1960s and 1970s led to total collapse of fishery in 1990s
- Scraping of the sea bed by trawlers destroys sea habitats
- Lost fishing nets trap large marine animals

### What can be done to protect oceans
- Requires:
	- Strong laws & enforcement to reduce pollution in rivers flowing into oceans
	- Collective action to reduce plastic pollution
	- Strong laws & enforcement to regulate fishing
	- Regulated protection of shorelines
	- Tackling root causes of climate change
Countries have legal jursidicion over their costal waters but the open ocean velongs to no =body so law is hard to enforce
