#review
2 parts
1. 15 multiple choice 1 mark each based on weeks 9-12 (30%)
2. 4 questions: select 3, each answer no longer than 1 page, single-spaced, each answer graded out of 5 (70%)
4. V = f(E,S,A)

3 key overarching themes of the course:
1. COnnectivity: human and natural systems are complex and interconnected. Changes to one part of a system have consequences for the other
2. Reasons for concern: human activity is doing considerable harm to natural systems, and if we're not careful, we will harm ourselves
3. Reasons for optimism: for all major global environmental challenges, we already have most of the technology and skills to solve them

![[Anthropocene]]

![[Ehrlich's "ImPAcT" model ]]
- Can use it as a starting point to investigate the relative impact of different groups of people on the environment
- Written answer question will ask you to use I=PAT to assess current trends in municipal solid waste disposal and diversion in Canada
## Biodiversity
- No specific questions on the exam
## Energy
- Human demand for energy is growing rapidly 
- Drilling, mining, and transporting fossil fuels create environmental impacts on water, soil, air
- The written answer asks how Canadian households might reduce their GHG emissions (knowing about household energy methods may be useful)

## Aquatic systems
- No specific questions about aquatic systems/water pollution on the exam

## Forests
- No specific questions about forest pollution on the exam

## Food systems
- The food we eat and produce today has evolved over thousands of years
- Our ability to produce food has grown rapidly in the last century to to new technologies, innovations, chemicals, fertilizers
- Improved health and household incomes in many parts of the world
- Food insecurity is still a problem in f=poorer countries
- Modern farming has many environmental impacts on soil, water and GHG emissions
- reviewed a variety of possible pathways to sustainable agriculture through the use of new technologies, new ways of farming, better land use and consumer choice
- Written answer questions on final asking to identify the various stages in the evoluiton of food production to date, and describe 3 different ways for building sustainable food systems in the future

## Climate change: causes
- Causes of climate change wont be on the final exam

## Climate change: impacts
If nothing is done to curtail GHGs
- temperatures will continue to rise
- precipitation patterns will change
- snow and ice will decline
- sea levels will rise

## climate change: mitigation
- get energy from non-fossil-fuel sources
- get transportation of fossil fuels
- making buildings energy-efficient
- reduce energy intensity of industries
- rebuild forests

## How to make mitigation happen
- Written answer question on the final that asks you how to identify two specific ways that Canadian households can reduce their GHG emissions and explain how these contribute to a "complete solution"

## Vulnerability and adaptation
 V = f(E,S,A)
 - Looked at vulnerability and adaptation to climate change impacts on insect-borne diseases, wildfires, food systems and sea level rise
There will be a written answer on the final exam asking what causes sea level rise and how to use the V=f(E, S, A) model to explain which people/types of communities are most vulnerable


Climate change impacts on food and health
- Burning embers diagram in the multiple choice part of the exam, be able to explain it

## Environment & health
- Human well-being & environmental well-being are interconnected
- The damage we do to the environment hurts our health, wellbeing
- Nature is important for our physical, mental, emotional & spiritual wellbeing
- Implication: everything we do to protect and experience nature  benefits us in ways beyond $
- Multiple questions on this

## Urban sustainability
- why important? cities are where most people live
- 'sustainability' has a different meaning in poor countries vs wealthy ones
- residents of sense cities have smaller ecological footprints than suburbs

### Solutions for cities
In low-income countries
- Prioritize housing, sanitation, air quality
In wealth countries
- Improve air/water quality, reduce solid waste going to landfill
- practice smart growth
- A written answer will ask you to use I=PAT to assess current trends in municipal solid waste disposal and diversion in Canada

## Economics
- None of the slides on Economics 101 etc are on the final exam

## Politics
- Governments don't always do the right thing
- Economic growth and the financial interests of political donors often take priority over nature
- Public interest and pressure are needed to make the government act when economic forces tell it to do nothing
- Only one multiple-choice question on the final exam from the politics lecture, about tuna

## Social exclusion from nature
- Not tested on final exam

## Complete solutions
- A written answer question on the final exam asks what they are and can use the concept to describe 2 ways Canadian households can reduce their GHG emissions  

## Subjects of multiple choice questions on final exam
Each bullet is 1 question
- Differences between viruses, bacteria & parasites
- Types of waterborne, foodborne & vector-borne diseases
- Case studies discussed in lecture of where people were exposed to toxins in ground/water
	- Niagra falls, northern Ontario, Bangladesh
- What is One Health?
- Causes of DALY in Wealthy Countries vs Poor Countries
- NDD
- Politics of tuna
- Burning ember diagrams
- What's a megacity
- Environmental challenges faced by cities
- What is smart growth?
- Transportation solutions for cities
- Waste diversion rates in Canada
- Problems with recycling
- Pros/cons of incineration

## Subjects of 4 written answer questions
- Complete solutions + household GHG emissions
- Evolution of food systems + future sustainability pathways
- IPAT + landfill waste and diversion
- V = f(E, S, A) + sea level rise
