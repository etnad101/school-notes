Epistemology - study/theory of knowledge

## What is knowledge
- knowledge = nod-accidentally justified true belief
- to believe = to accept a claim as true
- to justify a belief = to have reasons, evidence, and proofs for thinking the belief is more likely to be true than it is to be false
	- Justification comes in degrees: weak, strong, conclusive
- "non-accidentally justifies": to rule our accident or lunch
	- some philosophers require:
		- A method for producing true beliefs before they qualify as knowledge
		- A true belief must have the strongest, most conclusive form of justification before it qualifies as knowledge
- Descartes imposed both of the above conditions on knowledge and modelled it on geometry
	- p. 185

## Theories of justification
- foundationalism
- coherentism
- social epistemology

## Foundationalism
the analogy of a pyramid. The foundation is at the bottom and from that knowledge/justified beliefs, you can deduce more beliefs, and justify them
- 2 main theses:
	- i) Only beliefs can justify other beliefs
	- ii) To act as justifiers, beliefs must be themselves justified
- To stop the infinite regress that follows from i) + ii), foundationalists distinguish between:
	- Basic beliefs
	- Non-basic beliefs

## Descartes
- Foundationalist about justification
- Descartes' basic beliefs = self-justifying, 100% certain
- To arrive at them Descartes uses methodological doubt
- The cogito = the first and most important of Descartes' basic beliefs
	- short for Descartes', "I think therefore I am"
	- p. 193

## Coherentism
- Criticism of foundationalism: the distinction between basic and non-basic beliefs does not accurately reflect our practice of providing justification for beliefs
- Coherentism: a belief is justified by showing that it coheres with other beliefs when those other beliefs already make up a largely coherent body of beliefs
- William James = coherentist
	- P. 195-297

## Social Epistemology
- Criticism of both foundationalism and coherentism: both of these theories overemphasize the role of the individual knower while disregarding the social dimensions of knowledge
- Helen Longino: to qualify as knowledge a belief has to be contextualized in such a way that it avoids subjectivism and relativism
	- Pp. 201-203
