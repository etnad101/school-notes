# Death and Immortality
- ["] "is it good to never been born, or Having been born to pass through the gates of Hades as soon as possible"

- ["]  "As soon as a human has life, so soon is he old enough to die"

## Terms and definitions
- Death = permanent cessation of a person's existence
	- Still two meanings
		1. An event that marks the end of a person's life
		2. the state or condition that follows the event of our death
- Life = also ambiguous term
	1. biological or medical satus which for humans requires breath, heartbeat and brain activity
	2. biographical life = the series of events, activities, feelings and thoughs in which we play a part
- Afterlife = any continuation of a persons biographical life, wether finite or eternal after her biological death
- Personal immortality = a person never ceases to exist

## The doctrine of Reincarnation
1. Everything that comes to be, comes to be from its opposite
2. The living and the dead are opposites
	- [!] note dead means deceased
3. So, the dead must come to be from the living, and the living must come to be from the dead

- [?] What is wrong with this argument?
## The fallacy of equivocation
1. Pizza is better than nothing
2. Nothing is better than booze
Therefore: Pizza is better than booze
Both use a different meaning for nothing

## Aristotle: Two kinds of Opposites
- Contradictories: Opposites for which
	1. Nothing can be both; and
	2. whatever is not one must be the othre
		e.g green and not green
- Contraries: Opposites for which
	1. Nothing can be both; but
	2. some things can be neither of the two

## Argument from Indivisibility
1. The human body is divisible into parts
2. The person (or mind, soul, self, etc.) is not divisible into parts
3. Whatever is divisible is destructible; whatever is indivisible is indestructable
4. Therefore, the human body is destructible, but persons(minds, souls, selves, etc.) are indestructible

## Attempts to justify
- Descartes: what the mind does is "willing, felling, conceiving" but these are not different parts of the mind; they are different activities that one and the same mind performs

## Should we fear death?
- No:
	- Epicurus: since death is a no show (we are never co-present with it). When we are present death is not, and vice versa.
	- Lucretius: since there is a symmetry of prenatal nonexistence and posthumous nonexistence. To the extent to which we don't fear the former we should not fear the latter either.
- Yes:
	- Phillip Larkin: since it deprives us of things we now possess and value
		- Fear of death = dreading the loss of all encounters
