## Two views about the sources of ideas and knowledge
Descartes - Rationalism:
i: At least some ideas are innate
ii: Knowledge derrives from reason

## Locke: Two kinds of Ideas
- Simple ideas
	- "ideas in the reception of which the mind is only passive, ... the mind cannot make one to itself"
	- results of sensory processes
	- come upon us passively
	- received from information from things like sight, touch, taste, hearing
- Complex ideas
	- "Ideas thus made up of simple ones put together, I call complex"
	- ideas made up from simple ideas

## Rationalism vs. Empiricism
Do we have an idea?
- a. Locke
	- only if we acquired it directly from some experience or constructed it from ideas acquired directly from experience
- b. Descartes:
	- We also have some ideas that could not be derived from any experience (directly or indirectly) - these are "innate ideas"
Empiricists must work with a smaller budget of ideas


## Locke on Knowledge
- 3 types of knowledge
	- Intuitive
		- e.g. "black is not white"
		- we have seen lots of black things and can see that white things are different, and are in fact not black.
	- Demonstrative 
	- Sensitive

## Two views about the nature of knowledge
- Rene Descartes
	- Experience cannot provide the certainty needed to place knowledge on a firm foundation
- John Locke
	- Experience provides enough certainty
