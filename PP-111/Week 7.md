# Freedom and Determinism
- [?] The argument from divine foreknowledge does not support fatalism.
# Lecture
Determinism = Fundamental concep
Freedom = defined in relation to determinism

## Determinism
conceptual groundwork
1. Primer in modal logic
	- Principal 1: if something is necessary, then it is actual; if it is actual then it is possible
	- Principal 2: Necessary is equivalent to "not possible not" (if it is not possible that an event not occur, since there i no alternative to it, then the event is necessary)
1. Broader notion: fatalism
	- Fatalism: everything that happens, including everything we do, is necessary - there is no possibility of things happening any other way. The argument from divine foreknowledge does not support fatalism.

Determinism = fatalism with a twist
Casual determinism = all present and future events are made necessary (inevitable) by the past events that caused them.

Determinism so understood (i.e. causes necessitate their effects and everything is caused) rules out free will
## Argument for Casual Determinism
1. If future states of the universe can be validly deduced from physical laws and initial conditions,
## Compatibilism
Compatibilists disagree with Laplace and d'Holbach: there is one type of necessary causes which are compatible with free will: they are causing internal to us, not in the sense of spatial location, but in the sense of making us who we are. These causes are our own reasons, deliberations, motives, etc. An action caused in this way = free

## Libertarianism 1
*Metaphysical Libertarianism, Not Political*
The laws of physics are indeterministic so at least some of our actions are free

Problem: Indeterminacy leads to randomness, not to free will
- to have free will, we need to be in charge of our own actions; actions need to be caused or determined by us

## Libertarianism 2
Every action and event is caused but cuase makes their effects actual (NOT necessary) so at leas some of our actions are free
Ayer: only causes which compel or constrain us rule our freedom
